Preface 
Whatever views one holds about the penal law, no one will question 
its importance in society. This is the law on which men place their 
ultimate reliancejor protection against all the deepest injuries that 
human conduct can inflict on individuals and institutions. 
(Wechsler, "The Challenge oj a Model Penal Code." 65 Harvard 
Law Review 1097) 
The study of criminal law should not be considered as the memorization of a set ofruIes, 
but as an t..xamination of a cluster of ideas, principles, concepts and questions about human 
conduct and the control of human behavior. Criminal law should be viewed as a flexible 
system of values and principles about which reasonable people can and do disagree (Katkin, 
The Nature oj Criminal Law). 
This text has several goals: (1) to provide a comprehensive review of California criminal 
law, (2) to aid students in understanding what conduct constitutes criminal behavior, and (3) 
to provide a reference for the administration of justice professional. 
This text is written for criminal justice students and as a reference source for the non­
lawyer criminal justice professional. An objective of the text is to present the complicated 
and technical subject of criminal law in an easy to understand language and fOlmat. 
All books are biased to some degree. In many cases, the biases are unintentional and are 
caused by the author's background and frame of reference. This text may have a "conviction" 
bias, in that it is written from a law enforcement viewpoint based on the author's 
background. Despite this bias, there is still included a deep respect for the individual rights 
of all persons. 
To aid in understanding and as reference points, selected penal code provisions are 
included in the text. Code sections are presented as enacted by the legislature. At certain 
places, however, portions of the statutes are deleted. The omitted portions are indicated by 
ellipsis points ( ... ). In other places, to assist the reader in understanding the statutes, 
editorial comments are added by the author. The editorial comments are enclosed in 
brackets [ ] and are not a part of the code. 
Case citations are also included to assist those readers who may need a more in-depth 
treatment of a particular point. The abbreviations used in the citations are explained in 
Chapter 1. A decimal system is used within the text to allow easy reference to individual 
paragraphs. The first number of a paragraph will indicate the chapter in which the paragraph 
is located. 
At the end of each chapter, class discussion questions and self-study quizzes are 
included. After studying the chapter, readers should test their understanding of the material 
by answering the self-study quizzes and consider the possible issues and answers presented 
in the discussion questions.

Chapter 1 
Law and Crime 
Human control of contingent human behavior is the purpose of 
criminal law. (Clark and Marshall, On Crime) 
1.1 Purpose of Law in Society 
What is a crime? 
Why do we need criminal laws? 
What purposes do they serve in our society? 
Laws are principles which are created by our 
government for the' orderly functioning of our 
society. Criminal law is an attempt by society to 
eliminate or control harmful human behavior. It 
establishes standards of conduct and provides for 
punishment for those who are convicted of violat­
ing those standards. The greatest freedom for all is 
only possible through an organized society with a 
system of criminal law which protects our basic 
rights. A crime is an act committed or omitted in 
violation of a law forbidding or commanding it, 
and to which is annexed, upon conviction, a 
criminal punishment. Note: for the criminal law to 
work, the great majority of people must have 
confidence that it is fair and just. Does our system 
have that confidence? 
1.2 General and Specific Sources of'Law 
The criminal law in California comes from 
three primary sources; 
1. Federal and state constitutions 
2. Statutory law 
3. Case law 
Generally, constitutions provide rights and 
protection for individuals and restrictions of the 
power of the government to prosecute or punish. 
1 Statutes contain the substantive acts and pro­
cedural requirements for prosecution. Case law 
contains interpretations of constitutional and stat­
utory provisions. 
Constitutional Law 
Both the U.S. Constitution and the Constitu­
tion of the State of California are sources of 
criminal law for the courts in California. Consti­
tutions provide the framework for criminal law by: 
1. Limiting the power of the government. 
2. Establishing individual rights. 
3. Providing for the establishment of a judi­
cial system. 
As noted earlier, constitutions generally leave 
the creation and defmition of crimes to statutory 
enactments. The U.S. Constitution, for example, 
defines criminal acts in only two sections, Article 
III, Section 3 on treason and Amendment 13 
which forbids involuntary servitude except as 
punishment for crime. The state constitution 
defines criminal acts in a few more areas, but for 
the moSt part, the state constitution, like the 
federal, focuses on individual rights and limita­
tions of governmental power. 
Statutory Law 
In California, there are two types of statutory 
law, (1) statutes which are passed by the legislators 
and (2) initiatives which are passed by the voters. 
Under most circumstances, the power to designate 

2 Chapter 1 
state criminal offenses and provide for the punish­
ment of prohibited acts is reserved to the state 
legislature and cannot be delegated (People v. 
Knowles 35 C 2d 175). In establishing the ele­
ments of a Clime, the legislature may depart from 
the norm or common law concepts as long as the 
elements do not conflict with federal or state 
constitutions or federal law (People v. Perini 94 C 
573). 
Many of the state crimes are set forth in the 
Penal, Health and Safety and Vehicle Codes. 
Other state codes that contain numerous crimes 
are the Welfare and Institutions Code, Business 
and Professions Code, Fish and Grone Code, and 
Government Code. 
In California, the voters have the power via 
the initiative petition process to propose and 
approve statutes and amendments to the state 
constitution. An initiative measure is started by 
presenting a petition to the Secretary of State that 
has been signed by the number of voters that is 
equal to at least 5 percent of the number that voted 
in the last gubernatorial election for all the candi­
dates for governor. The Secretary of State is then 
required to submit the measure at the next general 
election held at least 31 days after the petition is 
certified or a special election may be called (Cal. 
Const. Art II, sec. 8). A simple majority of votes 
is sufficient to pass the measure and it takes effect 
the day after the election unless the measure 
provides oth '!rwise. Initiative measures should be 
interpreted liberally to give full effect to its objec­
tive and the needs of the people (Mills v. Trinity 
County 108 CA 3d 656). 
All laws of a general nature have uniform 
operation within the state. A local or special 
statute is invalid in any case if a general statute can 
be made applicable (Cal. Const. Art. IV sec. 16). 
A statute or initiative must embrace only one 
subject, which shall be expressed in its title. If a 
statute or initiative embraces more than one sub­
ject or the subject is not embraced in its title, the 
provision is void (Cal. Const. Art. N, sec. 9). The 
one subject limitation must, however, be inter­
preted liberally to uphold legislation whose 
various parts are reasonably germane to the sub­
ject contained in its title (Fair Political Practices 
Com. v. Superior Court 25 C 3d 33). Substantive and Procedural Laws 
Laws relating to criminal conduct may be 
divided into two general areas, substantive and 
procedural. Substantive law defines crimes and 
establishes punishments. Procedurallaw sets forth 
the rules and requirements that must be followed 
during the investigation, apprehension and trial of 
individual defendants. That portion of the penal 
code that prohibits theft of another's property 
(larceny) is substantive in nature, whereas, the 
Evidence Code is a procedural code. 
Case Law 
"Case law" is the phrase used to indicate 
appellate comt interpretations of the law. A sub­
stantial majority of "law" is case law, i.e. court 
opinions which interpret the meaning of constitu­
tions and statutes. Case law, also, helps clarify and 
narrow statutory law. For example, the U.S. Con­
stitution (Amendment XIV) provides that no state 
shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or prop­
erty, without due process oflaw. What constitutes 
"due process of law" is decided almost daily in 
the courts. There are hundreds of published opin­
ions issued by federal and state appellate and 
supreme courts each year. 
Court decisions interpret the relationship of 
one code provision to another, the meaning of 
words used in the code provision, the legislative 
intent in enacting the code provision, the scope 
and effect of the code provision and whether or not 
the provision violates any constitutional 
restrictions. 
Precedent is used when a legal principle has 
been decided by a court. The court decision is 
then precedent (guide) for similar situations. 
There are two basic types of precedent, manda­
tory and persuasive. Under mandatory precedent, 
when a higher appellate court renders a decision 
on an issue, the lower courts under the supervision 
of that court must follow the ruling or face reversal 
on appeal. For example, if the California Supreme 
Court decides an issue, then state appellate courts 
in California must follow that precedent. Persua­
sive precedent indicates a court decision that is not 
binding on a second court but is persuasive to the 
second court. For example, a court in California is 
faced with an issue that has never been decided by 

Law and Crime 3 
a California court. There is however a court in 
Nevada that has considered the same issue. The 
Nevada court decision is not binding on the Cal­
ifornia court, but is of some persuasive authority. 
Precedent is based on the principle of "stare 
decisis" which is discussed below. 
Common Law 
Common law is that body of law and 
juristic which was originated, 
developed and formulated and is 
administered in England .... common 
law comprises the body of principles 
and rules of action ... which are 
derived from usages and customs of 
immemorial antiquity. (Black's Law 
Dictionary) 
Most of the California criminal law principles 
are traceable to the common law of England. This 
is especially true of the underlying philosophy of 
criminal law. There are, however, no "common 
law crimes" in the state. Accordingly, to be a 
crime in California, there must be in existence 
some statute, ordinance or regulation prohibiting 
the conduct in question prior to the commission of 
the act (People v. Whipple 100 CA 261). The 
common law principles regarding the interpreta­
tion of criminal statutes are still used (17 Cal Jur 
3d (Rev.), Part 1, Sec. 15). For example, in 
defining a crime, the legislature may use words 
that are well known and defmed by criminal law 
(Re Application oj Lockett 179 C 581). 
1.3 Development of common law and stare 
decisis 
Development of Common Law 
Common law was the earliest source of crimi­
nallaws. It originated during the period of time 
that William the Conqueror was the King of 
England. At the time of the conquest (1066), there 
was no uniform criminal law in England. Individ­
ual courts were dominated by sheriffs who 
enforced the village rules as they saw fit. In ord.er 
to reduce the arbitrary aspects of the law, William 
decreed that all prosecutions would be conducted 
in the name ofthe King. (Note: a similar practice 
exists in California today where all cases are prosecuted in the name of the People of the State 
of California.) 
At that time in England, very few people 
could read or write. The king, the judges and the 
church authorities determined the elements and 
the scope of criminal offenses. In some cases, they 
even created new crimes. As William unified 
England as a nation, rather than isolated villages, 
the judges developed familiarity with the general 
customs, usages and moral concepts of the people. 
Judicial decisions began to be based on these 
general customs, usages and moral concepts. 
By the l600s, the primary criminal law of 
England was based on the mandatory rules of 
conduct laid down by the judges. These rules 
became the common law of England. Prior deci­
sions were accepted as authoritative precepts and 
were applied to future cases. When the English 
settlers came to America in the 1600s, they 
brought with them tlJe English common law. 
Except for few modifications, English common 
law became the common law of the colonies. 
During the American Revolution, there was a 
great deal of hostility toward the English in Amer­
ica. This hostility extended to the common law 
system. Accordingly, most of the new states 
enacted new statutes d~fining criminal acts and 
establishing criminal procedures. The statutes, 
however, basically enacted into statutory law what 
was formerly English common law. 
As noted earlier, many aspects of California's 
present day criminal law system is based on 
English common law. All states except Louisiana 
can trace their legal systems to the English com­
mon law system. Louisiana, whose system was 
originally based on the French and Spanish codal 
law concept, officially adopted the common law 
of England as th~ basis for their system in 1805. 
Stare Decisis 
"Stare Decisis" is a Latin word meaning "to 
abide by, or adhere to, decided cases." The doc­
trine provides that when a court has once laid 
down a principle of law as applicable to a certain 
state of facts, it will adhere to that principle, and 
apply it to all future cases, whf)re the facts are 
substantially the same (Moore v. City ('j Albany 98 
N.Y. 396). Stare decisis is a policy founded on the 

4 Chapter 1 
theory that security and certainty require that 
accepted and established legal principles, under 
which rights may accrue, be recognized and 
followed (Otter Tail Power Co. v. Von Bank 72 
N.D. 497). 
1.4 Repeal/ Amendment 
R",peal of Statute Government Code 9606 
Any statute may be repealed at any time, 
except when vested rights would be impaired. 
Persons acting under any statute act in contempla­
tion of this power. 
Termination or Suspension of Law Creating 
Criminal Offense Government Code 9608 
The termination or suspension (by whatsoever 
means effected) of any law creating a criminal 
offense does not constitute a bar to the indictment 
or information and punishment of an act already 
committed in violation of the law so terminated or 
suspended, unless the intention to bar such indict­
ment or information and punishment is expressly 
declared by an applicable provision of law. 
Discussion 
Criminal statutes are repealed or amerded by 
other legislation either directly or by implication 
(People v. Dobbins 73 C. 257). A statute is 
repealed directly by legislation expressly repeal­
ing the statute in question. 
Repeal by Implication 
Repeal by implication is not favored by the 
courts (People v. Armstrong 100 CA 2d Supp 821). 
A statute is repealed or amended by implication 
when a later statute is enacted that is inconsistent 
with it. Normally a general statute will not be 
considered as repealed by a special or statute of 
limited applicability unless the intent of the legis­
lature is clear (People v. Deibert 117 CA 2d 410). 
It is assumed that the legislature did not intend 
to repeal a former statute by a later statute if, by a 
fair and reasonable construction, effect can be 
given to both statutes (People v. Armstrong 100 CA 
2d Supp 852). Note: if two general statutes are 
clearly in conflict with each other, the presump­
tion is that the latest enacted statute prevails (Gov. 
Code 9605). Effect of Repeal 
The repeal of a statute under which a person 
has been convicted does not affect the conviction 
if the conviction is final. Government Code 9608 
(quoted above) is the "general saving clause" for 
repealed criminal statutes. It modifies common 
law by allowing for the prosecution of acts which 
were criminal at the time of commission even 
though the statute which made them criminal has 
since been repealed. Its purpose is to authorize 
prosecution under a fonner statute in order to 
avoid a situation where the defendant could not be 
prosecuted under any law, simply because the 
legislature has modified the statute in question 
between the time that the act was committed and 
the time of trial (Re Estrada 63 CA 2d 740). The 
California Supreme Court decided in 1893, that a 
person should be punished under the state law a') it 
existed at the time of the commission of the 
offense rather than subsequent amendment to such 
law. This principle has since been upheld by the U. 
S. Supreme Court (McNulty v. California 149 US 
645). 
The above rules apply even where the act is no 
longer a criminal offense. For ex.ample, if Califor­
nia were to repeal its traffic laws as of January 1, 
19XX; an accused could be convicted and 
punished on January 3, 19XX on a traffic violation 
that occurred prior January 1. 
1.5 The Nature and Classifications of Crimes 
Crimes are classified as "mala in se" or "mala 
prohibita" crimes. Other classifications include 
"crimes involving moral turpitude," "infamous 
crimes" and "high crimes." 
Mala in Se and Mala Prohibita Crimes 
An act is said to be malum in se when it 
is inherently and essentially evil, that 
is, immoral in its nature and injurious 
in its consequences, without regard to 
the fact that it is a violation of the law. 
(State v. Shedoudy 45 N.M. 516) 
. Mala Prohibitum: A wrong pro­
hibited; a thing which is wrong 
because prohibited; an act which is 
not inherently immoral, but becomes 
so because its commission is expressly 

Law and Crime 5 
forbidden by positive law. (Black's 
Law Dictionary) 
At common law, crimes were classified as 
either "mala in se" or "mala prohibita". Mala in se 
crimes involve conduct that is inherently and 
essentially wrong and injurious. Crimes such as 
murder, rape, incest, arson, etc. are considered as 
mala in se crimes. Mala prohibita crimes are 
wrong only because they violate legislative acts 
and not because they are inherently and essentially 
wrong in themselves. Most mala prohibita crimes 
involve traffic, social and economic behavior. 
Criminal violation of a rent control statute is an 
example of a mala prohibitum crime. 
Moral Turpitude 
Moral turpitude is a classification used to 
describe acts that are contrary to justice, honesty, 
modesty, or good morals (Marsh v. State Bar of 
California 210 C 303). It has also been defmed as 
an act of baseless, vileness, or depravity in the 
private and social duties which one person owes to 
others, or to society in general (Traders & General 
Ins. Co. v. Russell S.W. 2d 1079). Crimes that 
suggest a lack of honesty, or that imply immoral 
conduct are considered as crimes involving moral 
turpitude. For example, perjury, theft, and rape 
are considered as crimes involving moral turpi­
tude. Note that crimes involving moral turpitude 
may also be considered as mala in se crimes. 
Conviction of a crime involving moral turpi­
tude may disqualify a person from holding a 
professional qualification such as an "attorney at 
law" (Re Application of Westenherg 167 C 309). 
The conviction of an attempt to commit a crime 
involving moral turpitude has the same dis­
aualifications attached as a conviction of the 
~ctual offense (Re O'Connell 184 C 584). 
Infamous Crimes 
While various crimes are referred to as 
infamous crimes in the California Constitution 
and statutes, there is no statutory definition of it. 
An infamous crime is one that entails infamy upon 
the one who committed the crime (Butler v. Went­
worth 24 A. 456). At common law, the term 
infamous was applied to those crimes upon the conviction of which, the person became incompe­
tent to testify as a witness on the theory that they 
were so depraved as to be unworthy of credit 
(Black's Law Dictionary). It was not the character 
of the crime that determined whether or not it was 
an infamous crime, but the punishment that may 
be imposed for conviction of it (Brede v. Powers 
263 U.S. 4). 
Crimen Falsi 
"Crimen falsi" is a phrase used to describe 
those crimes that involve the element offalsehood 
and includes everything which has a tendency to 
injuriously affect the administration of justice by 
the introduction of falsehood and fraud (Black's 
Law Dictionary). The phrase is, also, used as a 
general designation of a class of offenses involv­
ing fraud and deceit. Crimen falsi crimes include 
forgery, perjury, using false weights or measure­
ments and counterfeiting. 
High Crimes 
High crimes is a phrase used to describe those 
crimes that if convicted of, will disqualify the 
offender from holding public office or making the 
person incompetent to act as ajuror (Cal. Code of 
Civ. Pro. 199 (b)). High crimes include bribery, 
perjury, forgery, and malfeasance in office by a 
public official. 
1.6 Crimes Without Victims 
Crimes without victims or "victimless 
crimes" are those crimes that have no adverse 
impact on persons other than the actor. They can 
also be considered as "consensual crimes". Gam­
bling, prostitution and drug abuse have tradi­
tionally been considered by some as victimless 
crimes. One problem with the enforcement of 
victimless crimes is that the police will often not 
have an aggrieved victim to testify against the 
offender. Criminologists have traditionally 
debated as to whether or not acts between consen­
sual adults should be considered as criminal. The 
justification for imposing criminal sanctions for 
the violation of those statutes on victimless crimes 
are that there are at least "moral victims" to those 
crimes and that society in general is a victim in 
those situations.

1.7 Federal Constitutional Provisions 
U.S. Constitution, Amendment 14, Section 1 
. " No State shall make, or enforce any law 
which shall abridge the privileges or immunities 
of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State 
deprive any person of the life, liberty, or property, 
without due process of law .... 
Discussion 
The U. S. Constitution provides certain rights 
and protection for individuals and restricts the 
power of the states to criminally punish individ­
uals, The "due process" clause of the 14th 
Amendment has been interpreted by the U.S. 
Supreme Court to place certain limitations on the 
power of states to prosecute individuals. Since the 
limitations are placed on the states by the U. S. 
Constitution, the U.S. Supreme Court makes the 
final decision on whether or not state actions 
violate those limitations. There are similar protec­
tions contained in the Califomia State Constitu­
tion. The general limitations on state action 
imposed by the federal constitution are included 
below. 
Ex Post Facto Laws 
An "ex post facto law" is one that: 
1. makes an act occurring before the enact­
ment of the law a crime, 
2. aggravates a crime or makes it greater than 
it was when committed, 
3. increases the punishment after the offense 
was committed, or 
4. changes the rules of evidence or procedure 
to require less or different evidence than 
was required at the time the offense was 
committed. 
Ex post facto laws are prohibited by both the 
U.s. and the state constitution. An example of an 
ex post facto law would be the enactment of a 
statute on January 1, making an act committed 
three weeks earlier a crime. A more likely case is 
where the punishment for the crime is increased 
after the commission of the offense. For example, 
an individual is arrested in 1985 for driving under 
the influence. He is prosecuted in 1986. On Janu­
ary 1, 1986 the punishment for driving under the 
influence was increased. The accused in this case is subject only to the punishment that was in effect 
in 1985, the time the offense was committed. 
Bill of Attainder 
Neither the U.S. Constitution nor the state 
constitution defmes the phrase' 'bill of attainder" 
even though both prohibit it. The judicial inter­
pretation of "bill of attainder" includes those 
cases where the punishment is legislatively 
inflicted on a particular person or class. For exam­
ple, passing a law punishing a certain person by 
name would be a bill of attainder. Note: different 
punishments can be inflicted on a class of persons 
if there is a legitimate reason for doing so. For 
example, persons who have prior convictions can 
by legislative mandate be punished more severely 
than those who have not been convicted of any 
prior offenses. 
Certainty 
Criminal statutes must be certain and definite 
in order that a person will know what conduct is 
prohibited and what is not. The certainty must be 
such that a person of ordinary intelligence would 
recognize what conduct is prohibited by reading 
the statute (People v. Pace 73 CA 548). The 
purpose of this requirement is to prevent the 
accidental commission of prohibited conduct. A 
criminal statute which prohibited' 'picketing" was 
too vague and therefore unconstitutional (Re 
Application of Harder 9 CA 2d 153). 
Equal Protection 
The U.S. Constitution prohibits any state from 
denying to any person within its jurisdiction the 
equal protection of the laws (U.S. Const. Amend. 
14). In addition, the state constitution prohibits the 
legislature from enacting any special statute if a 
general statute can be made applicable (Cal. 
Const. Art. IV, sec. 16). In addition, the state 
constitution requires that all laws of a general 
nature must have a uniform operation. The equal 
protection clauses, however. do not prohibit the 
legislature from fixing different penalties for dif­
ferent offenses or from permitting courts to 
impose variations in punishment for the convic­
tion of the same offense by different individuals 
(People v. Dawson 210 C 366). 

Law and Crime 7 
1.8 Police Power of the State 
Police power is the power and responsibility 
of a political unit, such as a county or city, to 
promote and provide for public health, safety and 
morals within its jurisdictional limits. The U.S. 
Supreme Court noted that police power compre·· 
hends the duty, within constitutional limitations, 
to protect the well-being and tranquility of a 
community (Kovacs v. Cooper 336 U.S. 77). 
The California constitution provides that 
counties and cities may establish ordinances that 
regulate local, police, and sanitary procedures and 
conduct within their respective geographic limits. 
The ordinances may not conflict with general laws 
(Cal. Const. Art. XI, Sec. 7). Any ordinance 
which penalizes conduct already covered by a 
general law is void (Aifsten v. Superior Court 20 
CA 269). The police power, also, may not be used 
by municipalities to legislate subject matter that is 
of such statewide concern that it can no longer be 
considered as only a local concern. 
A state or political subdivision of a state 
cannot act arbitrarily in the use of the police 
power. In addition, the state or municipality must 
be able to show that there is a compelling public 
need to regulate the conduct in question. The 
statute must also not infringe on any individual 
right secured by the constitution. Cases where the 
courts have struck down statutes based on police 
power include: 
1. A statute that required all persons to attend 
the church of their choice every Sunday. 
(This statute violates the First Amendment 
and is not within the police power of a 
state.) 
2. A statute forbidding unmarried persons of 
the opposite sex from living together in 
the same house or apartment. (No legiti­
mate state concern.) 
Cases where the use of the police power has 
been upheld include: 
1. Requiring motorcycle riders to wear pro­
tective headgear. (Note: several state 
supreme courts have struck down similar 
statutes. For example, the Ohio Supreme 
Court stated that "liberty" included the 
right to be foolish as long as others would not be injured. See State v. Betts 252 N.E. 
2d 866.) 
2. Gun control legislation. 
3. Requiring the use of seat belts in 
automobiles. 
1.9 Doctrine of Preemption 
As noted above, a local ordinance will be 
invalidated ifit directly conflicts with state law. In 
some cases, however, even where there are no 
conflicts between state law and local ordinances, 
the local ordinance will be void if it appears that 
the legislative purposes of the state law was to 
fully regulate the field (50 Cal. L. Rev. 740). This 
is based on the "doctrine of preemption". Accord­
ingly, the doctrine provides that in those areas 
where the state sees fit to adopt a general scheme 
of laws for the regulation of a particular area, 
whatever aspects covered by state law ceases to be 
subjects that may be controlled by local legislation 
(In re Lane 58 C 2d 99). 
The factors used to determine if state law 
preempts the local regulations are: 
1. Has the subject matter been fully covered 
by state law so as to indicate that it has 
become exclusively a matter of state 
concern? 
2. Are the state statutes couched in terms to 
indicate that clearly a paramount state 
concern will not tolerate further or addi­
tionallocal control? 
3. Is the subject matter such that the adverse 
effects of a local ordinance on transient 
citizens of the state outweighs any benefits 
of local control? (53 Cal. L. Rev. 902) 
1.10 Dual Federalism 
Dual federalism refers to the fact that in 
California, there are two separate criminal law 
systems (state and federal) operating together and 
in many situations overlapping each other. The 
federal government is restricted by the U.S. Con­
stitution to only those powers set forth or implied 
by the constitution. It is, therefore, a limited 
criminal law system. The majority of criminal 
cases involve the violation of state penal codes and 
are tried in state criminal cases. For example, Los 
Angeles County courts, alone, try more criminal 

8 Chapter 1 
cases each year than are tried in the entire federal 
system. (Despite this fact, there are presently over 
2800 federal crimes.) 
Federal crimes fall within three broad 
classifications: 
1. Crimes affecting interstate commerce. 
The constitution gives Congress the exclu­
sive power to regulate interstate com­
merce. Such crimes include the Mann Act 
(taking a female across state lines for 
immoral purposes), Dyer Act (transport­
ing stolen automobiles across state lines), 
Lindberg Act (kidnaping where the victim 
is taken across state lines or the presump­
tion that the victim has been taken across 
state lines) and the Fugitive Felon Act. 
2. Crimes committed beyopd the jurisdiction 
of any state. This includes crimes com­
mitted on American ships on the high seas 
or at overseas military bases. 
3. Crimes which interfere with the activities 
of the federal government. This broad 
category includes the robbery of a 
federally insured bank, federal income tax 
fraud, attempts to overthrow the U.S. Gov­
ernment or robbery of a post office. 
As noted in Chapter 3, the conduct of a person 
may result in the violations of both a federal and a 
state law, and thus be convicted in both federal and 
state courts. 
For a federal court to become involved in the 
trial of a state court, there must be a. "federal 
issue". Accordingly, if a person commits murder 
under a state penal code, the case will be decided 
by state courts unless a federal issue is involved. 
In this situation, however, the accused by claim­
ing that his/her conviction violates one of the 
rights protected by the U.s. Constitution induces 
a federal issue (violation of federal constitution). 
If this occurs, then a federal court would have 
jurisdiction to decide the federal issues involved. 
111 Legal Research and Methodology 
Researching legal issues and cases is different 
from standard literature research. Once the stu­
dent has mastered the concepts and methodology, legal issues, case law and statutes can be located 
quickly and efficiently. 
In conducting legal research, the researcher 
should: 
1. Research the subject systematkally going 
sequentially from one source (e.g. stat­
utes, court decisions, or law reviews) to 
the next. 
2. Check to insure tllat the latest available 
information has been consulted. For 
example, use only the latest copy of the 
penal code. Using only the latest refer­
ences is essential because legal informa­
tion and points of authority change 
frequently as the results of statutory modi­
fications and new court decisions. 
3. In researching legal questions, be patient 
and thorough. To many questions, the law 
frequently does not yield easy "yes or no" 
answers. At times, the answers will be 
considered as ambiguous and conflicting. 
Legal Citations 
Legal citations are a form of shorthand to 
assist in locating the legal sources. Appellate 
court decisions are published in case law books, 
more popularly known as "reporters". The basic 
rules of legal citation are as follows: 
1. In most citation formats, the volume or 
title number is presented first. 
2. Next is the standardized abbreviation for 
the legal reference source. 
3. Next, in the case of court cases, is the page 
number of the first page of the decision. In 
the case of statutory references, it is the 
section number of the statute. 
For example, the citation, 107 C. 468, refers 
to the case starting on page 468 of volume 107 of 
California Reports. 
The standard abbreviations used in citing 
federal and state authorities include: 
1. Court decisions: 
U S (United States Reports) [Contains 
U.S. Supreme Court decisions.] 
C or Cal. (California Reports) [Contains 
California Supreme Court decisions.] 

Law and Crime 9

sions Code) 
W & I C (California Welfare and Institu­
tions Code) 
Note: United States Reports (U S), reports 
only decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court and 
California Reports (C, C 2d or C 3d), reports only 
decisions of the California Supreme Court. Cal­
ifornia Courts of Appeal decisions are reported in 
California Appellate Reports (CA, CA 2d, or CA 
3d). 
Legal Digests 
Legal digests are not legal authorities. They 
are used as research tools. Legal digests identify 
and consolidate similar issues by topical arrange­
ment. The most popular legal digest for California 
(West's California Digest) is published by West 
Publishing Company. It divides the entire body of 
law into seven main divisions, thirty-two subhead­
ings and approximately four hundred topics. A 
digest is published for each series of case 
reporters. Each topic is assigned a digest "key" 
number. For example, Crim Law 625 is the key number for the legal issue of "exclusion from 
criminal trial". 
The key number is the same for each digest 
published. Legal points from court decisions are 
published with a brief statement of the legal point 
involved and the case citation for the court deci­
sion being digested. If, for example, a point being 
researched is located in a digest under Crim Law 
625, then reference to other digests using the 
same key number (Crim Law 625) will help locate 
other court decisions on the same or similar 
issues. 
Shepard's Citations 
Shepard's Citations, started in 1873 by Frank 
Shepard, are widely used to ascertain the current 
status of a statute or court decision. Shepard's 
Citations, more popularly known as citators, ana­
lyze each appellate court decision as to; the his­
tory of the case, other decisions where that 
decision has been cited and whether ornot the rule 
of the case has been modified, overruled or 
approved by other cases. A similar analization is 
used for statutes. For a detailed explanation of how 
to use Shepard's Citations, read the first pages of 
any citator volume. 
Legal Dictionaries and Encyclopedias 
Like Shepard's Citations and legal digests, 
legal dictionaries and encyclopedias are not legal 
authorities, but research tools. The most popular 
legal dictionary is Black's Law Dictionary. 
Legal encyclopedias provide discussions on 
various legal points in encyclopedic form based 
on court decisions and statutes. They are arranged 
by broad legal topics and subdivided by individual 
areas. The most popular encyclopedia used in 
California is California Jurisprudence. Third Edi­
don (Revised). It provides a detailed discussion on 
state legal issues. It is cited as Cal Jur 3d (Rev). 
For example, the citation "17 Cal Jur 3d (Rev) 
125" refers to volume 17 of California Jurispru­
dence, Third Edition (Revised), section 125. The 
cited section deals with robbery and it provides a 
detailed discussion on it. 
Witkin's California Law 
A popular series on California Law is 
Witkin's. In the criminal law area, there is the 

10 Chapter 1 
California Crimes (two volumes) and California 
Criminal Procedure (two volumes). The crimes 
volumes contain a critical textbook treatment of 
the entire field of California criminal law , and the 
procedure volumes does the same for California 
criminal procedural law. Witkin, also, has a multi­
volume series on California civil law and civil 
procedure. 
Law Reviews 
The major law schools in California publish 
law reviews. In general, the law reviews contain 
scholarly articles of various aspects of California 
law. They are not legal authority, but are often 
cited as persuasive authorities. The five most 
popular law reviews in California are: 
University of California Law Review (Cal. 
L. Rev.) 
Hastings Law Journal (Hast. L. J.) 
Stanford Law Review (Stan. L. Rev.) 
University of California, Los Angeles 
Law Review (U.C.L.A. L. Rev.) 
University of Southern California Law 
Review (So. Cal. L. Rev.) 
Law reviews are cited similar to court cases. 
For example, an article in volume 50 of the 
Standard Law Review which begins on page 192 
would be cited as: 50 Stan. L. Rev. 192. 
CALJIC 
California Jury Instructions--Criminal (CAL­
HC) is a series of volumes containing standard 
jury instructions that a judge may use to instruct 
the jury regarding elements of crimes, defenses 
and other matters relating to the trial. 
LARMAC 
LARMAC is a consolidated alphabetized 
index to the constitution and laws of California. It 
includes all twenty-eight codes and the general 
laws of California. It is the most complete index 
available on California law. 
112 Attorney General Opinions 
Government Code 12510 Department of Justice 
The Attorney General is head of the Depart­
ment of Justice. 
Government Code 12511 State Legal Matters The Attorney General has charge, as attorney, 
of all legal matters in which the State is interested, 
except the business of The Regents of the Univer­
sity of California and of such other boards or 
officers as are by law auth0l1zed to employ an 
attorney. 
Government Code 12519 Opinions on Questions 
of Law 
The Attorney General shall give his opinion in 
writing to the Legislature or either house thereof, 
and to the Governor, the Secretary of State, Con­
troller, Treasurer, State Lands Commission, 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, any state 
agency prohibited by law from employing legal 
counsel other than the Attorney General, and any 
district attorney when required, upon any ques­
tion of law relating to their respective offices. 
Discussion 
As required by statutes, the Attorney General 
provides written conclusions on the legal ques­
tions submitted by the Governor, State Senate, 
Assembly, or any of the other state officials. The 
opinions are generally of two types, formal and 
informal. Formal opinions concern legal ques­
tions that are of general statewide concern. They 
are published in Opinions o/the Attorney General. 
Informal opinions normally concern problems 
that are of local interest only. Informal opinions 
are not usually published, but many are available 
to the public from the Attorney General's Office. 
Informal opinions are generally issued in letter 
format. 
Attorney General opinions are considered as 
"quasi-judicial" in character. While they do not 
have the force and effect of statutes or court 
decisions, they are entitled to great weight and are 
persuasive to the courts (D'Amico v. Medical 
Examiners 6 CA 3d 716 and People v. Berry 147 
CA 2d 33).

Chapter 2 
The Nature of Law 
Justice is the right to the maximum of individual independence 
compatible with the same liberty for others. (Henri-Frederic Amiel, 
1870) 
2.1 Definition of Crime 
Penal Code 15 Definition of "Crime" or Public 
Offense 
A crime or public offense is an act committed 
or omitted in violation of a law forbidding or 
commanding it, and to which is annexed, upon 
conviction, either of the following punishments: 
1. Death, 
2. Imprisonment, 
3. Fine, 
4. Removal from Office; or, 
5. Disqualification to hold and enjoy any 
office of honor, trust or profit in this state. 
Discussion 
While the word "crime" may comprehend 
every violation of a public law, the statutory 
definition is much narrower (17 Cal.Jur. 3rd (Rev.) 
1). To set forth a crime, a statute must first 
describe Hie conduct that is prohibited and second 
provide a punishment for violation of the act. 
There are two types of statutes in the penal code, 
(1) enabling statutes and (2) criminal statutes. If 
the statute does not attach a punishment for the 
violation of it, it is an enabling statute. The enab­
ling statutes are considered as explanatory in 
nature. 
A prohibited act is not a crime unless the 
statute provides a punishment (People v. McNulty 
93 C 427). If the statute, however, states that the 
13 prohibited act shall be punished as a felony, mis­
demeanor or infraction, but does not include a 
specific penalty provision for its violation, then 
the general punishment section of the Penal Code 
applies (Re Application of Gohike 72 CA 536). In 
California, the words "crim~4!nd "public 
offense" are considered as synonymous (Burks v. 
United States 287 F 2d 117). 
If the statute prohibits a certain act or omis­
sion and provides a punishment for the violation, it 
is a crime. rn1ere is no requirement that the statute 
expressly declare the act or omission of a clime. 
The infliction of harm to someone or damage to 
property, also, is not required unless expressly 
declared to be an element by the legislation (Peo­
ple v. Morrison 54 CA 469). 
All crimes are prosecuted in the state courts in 
the name of "The People of the State of Califor­
nia" and by written complaint (p C 740). Crimes 
are considered as crimes against the "People of 
the State of California," in general, and not 
against persons individually. Accordingly, indi­
vidual persons (except officials in the perfor­
mance of their duties) have no official voice in 
making decisions on whether or not to prosecute 
for the violation of a criminal offense (People v. 
Weber 84 CA 2d 126). 
2.2 Purpose of' Criminal Law 
A U.S. District Court expressed the objective 

14 Chapter 2 
and purpose of criminal law in U.S. v. Watson (146 
F. Supp. 258) as follows: 
The object of the criminal law is to 
protect the public against depredations 
of a criminal. On the other hand, its 
purpose is also to prevent the convic­
tion of the innocent, or the conviction 
of a person whnse guilt is not estab­
lished beyond a reasonable doubt. The 
court must balance all these aims at the 
trial. 
One of the functions of criminal law is to 
punish persons who have committed criminal 
offenses. Why punishment is considered neces­
sary was discussed by the Chief Justice of the 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 1930 (Common­
wealth v. Ritter 13 D & C 285). He stated: 
Generally speaking, there have been 
advanced four theories as the basis 
upon which society should act in 
imposing penalties upon those who 
violate its laws. These are: (1) To bring 
about the refonnation of the evil-doer; 
(2) to effect retribution or revenge 
upon him; (3) to restrain him phys­
ically, so as to make it impossible for 
him to commit further crimes; and (4) 
to deter others from similarly violating 
the law. 
U.S. Criminal Code Reform Act of 1973 (93d 
Cong.,lst Sess., March 27, 1973) 
The general purposes of this title are: 
(a) to define conduct which indefensibly 
causes or threatens haml to those individuals or 
public interests for which federal protection is 
appropriate. 
(b) to prescribe sanctions for engaging in such 
conduct which will: (1) assure just punishment for 
such conduct; (2) deter such conduct; (3) protect 
the public from persons who engage in such 
conduct; and (4) promote the correction and 
rehabilitation of persons who would engage in 
such conduct ... 
There are many scholarly works on the pur­
pose of criminal law. The most basic reasons 
attributed by most of the works are to: 1. Provide a framework of behavior that can 
be repeatedly applied with sufficient uni­
fonnity that the desired end will be contin­
uously reproduced within tolerated limits 
(Witkin, California Crimes, Sec. 1). 
2. Deter criminal behavior. 
3. Award good behavior. 
This is accomplished when bad behavior is 
punished. Persons who have not committed 
offenses for which they could be punished are 
awarded by not being punished (passive rewards). 
If no behavior was punished, then non-punish­
ment would not be a reward. 
2.3 Construction of Penal Statutes 
Penal Code 4 Construction According to Fair 
Import 
The rule of common law, that penal statutes 
are to be strictly construed, has no application to 
this code. All its provisions are to be construed 
according to the fair import of their ternls, with a 
view to effect its objects and to promote justice. 
Penal Code 5 Construction as to Existing Laws 
The provisions of this code, so far as they are 
substantially the same as existing statutes, must 
be construed as continuations thereof, and not as 
new enactments. 
Penal Code 7 Statutory Meaning of Various 
Words [part of first paragraph only] 
Words used in this code in the present tense 
include the future as well as tlle present; words 
used in the masculine gender include the feminine 
and neuter; the singular number includes the plu­
ral and the plural includes the singular; the word 
"person" includes a corporation as well as a 
natural person; the word "county" includes "city 
and county"; writing includes printing and type­
writing .... 
Discussion 
As stated above, the common law rule that 
penal statutes are to be strictly construed has been 
modified in California. Instead, penal statutes are 
constmed according to their nonnal usage with a 
view toward the objectives of the statute in ques­
tion. Despite this rule, there is still the require­
ment to give the defendant the benefit of any 
reasonable doubt (Carlos v. Superior Court 35 C 

The Nature of Law 15 
3d 35). Accordingly, when a statute is capable of 
two reasonable constructions, the one most favor­
able to the defendant should be used (People v. 
Ralph 24 C 2d 575). 
The general rules of construction for criminal 
statutes are: 
The codes of the state are to be read as a single 
unified whole, as if they were a single statute (Re 
Porterfield 28 C 2d 91). 
Words used in a statute will be construed in 
accordance with their commonly understood 
meanings (Re Newbern 53 C 2d 786). 
If a statute is capable of being reasonably 
construed in more ways than one, the most 
restricted meaning will normally be used (People 
v Kelly 27 CA 2d Supp 771). 
A statute should be construed with reference 
to its purpose (People v. King 115 CA 2d Supp 
875). 
If a special and general statute both proscribe 
the same criminal act, the presumption is that the 
special statute will prevail (17 Cal Jur 3d (Rev) 14). 
Where the constitutional right or privilege of 
an individual is concerned, there should be a 
liberal, but reasonable, construction in favor of 
the individual (Ex parte Cohen 104 C 524). 
If the common law meaning is not repugnant 
to due process, it shall be used, unless the terms 
are defined by constitutional or statutory provi­
sions or prior judicial decisions (Re Application of 
Lockett 179 C 581). 
Words and phrases must be construed accord­
ing to the context and approved usage of the 
language; but technical words and phrases, and 
such other as may have acquired a peculiar and 
appropriate meaning in law, must be construed 
according to such peculiar and appropriate mean­
ing (P C 7). 
Statutory Meanings of Various Words 
The statutory meanings of various words are 
contained in section 7 of the Penal Code. Listed 
below are some of the key words defined in that 
section: The word "willfully," when applied to the 
intent with which an act is done or omitted, 
implies simply a purpose or willingness to commit 
the act, or make the omission referred to. It does 
not require any intent to violate law, or to injure 
another, or to acquire any advantage. 
The words "neglect," "negligence," "negli­
gent," and "negligently" import a want of such 
attention to the nature or probable consequences 
of the act or omission as a prudent man ordinarily 
bestows in acting in his own concerns. 
The word "corruptly" imports a wrongful 
design to acquire or cause some pecuniary or 
other advantage to the person guilty of the act or 
omission referred to, or to some other person. 
The word "malice" and "maliciously" import 
a wish to vex, annoy, or injure another person, or 
an intent to do a wrongful act, established either 
by proof or presumption of law. 
The word "knowingly" imports only a knowl­
edge that the fact exists which brings the act or 
omission within the provisions of this code. It does 
not require any knowledge of the unlawfulness of 
such act or omission. 
The word "bribe" signifies anything of value 
or advantage, present or prospective, or any prom­
ise or undertaking to give any, asked, given or 
accepted, with a corrupt intent to influence, 
unlawfully, the person to whom it is given, in his 
or her action, Yote, or opinion, in any public or 
official capacity. 
The word "property" includes both real and 
personal property. 
The word "month" means a calendar month, 
unless otherwise expressed; the word "daytime" 
means L'1e period between sunrise and sunset, and 
the word "nighttime" means the period between 
sunset and sunrise. [Note: "nighttime" is a mean­
ingless distinction in most modern day criminal 
statutes, especially in California. At common law, 
the fact that the crime occurred during "night­
time" was an aggravating factor.] 
2.4 Conflicts Between Laws U. S. Constitu­
tion, Article VI [second paragraph only] 
This Constitution, and the Laws ofthe United 
States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; 

16 Chapter 2 
and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, 
under the Authority of the United States, shall be 
the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in 
every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in 
the Constitution or Laws of any State to the 
Contrary notwithstanding. [TIns clause is com­
monly known as the "Supremacy Clause".] 
The Supreme Law of the Land 
As stated above, the United States Constitu­
tion is the supreme law of the land. Any state 
constitution, statute or court ruling whlch is in 
conflict with it is unconstitutional. In the U.S. 
COImitution, there are 23 individual rights guar­
anteed to U.S. residents. Of these, 12 pertain to 
criminal law and procedure. Most of the rights are 
contained in the amendments to the constitution. 
There are only two sections of the federal consti­
tution which forbids or defines conduct as crimi­
nal. They are Article III, Section 3, which defines 
treason and Amendment XIII, Section 1, which 
forbids slavery or involuntary servitude. 
Each criminal law enacted in California must 
be tested to ensure that it does not violate the 
rights contained in the federal constitution. The 
U. S. Supreme Court makes the final decision on 
whether or not a state constitution or enactment 
conflicts with the federal constitution and is thus 
unconstitutional. 
The federal constitution also provides that 
federal laws and treaties are part of the supreme 
law of the land. Accordingly, in case of conflicts, 
first in supremacy is the U.S. Constitution fol­
lowed by federal statutes and U.S. treaties. If any 
part of the California Constitution or a California 
Code is in conflict with any of those three laws, 
the California enactment is unconstitutional. 
The California Constitution 
The first part of the California Constitution is 
a Declaration of Rights. The declaration reflects 
many of the same rights as set forth in the U. S. 
Constitution. Any state statute which conflicts 
with the safeguards contained in the California 
Constitution is unconstitutional. The California 
Supreme Court makes the final decision on 
whether or not a state criminal law is in conflict 
with the state constitution. Independent State Grounds 
Most of the safeguards in the state constitu­
tion are also contained in the U.S. Constitution, 
and the U.S. Supreme Court makes the final 
determination on federal constitutional issues. If 
however, the issue is not a federal one and is 
decided on "independent state grounds", the Cal­
ifornia courts make the final decision on the 
question. For example, since 1974 the prosecution 
under federal law has been allowed to impeach an 
accused's in court testimony by use of a prior out 
of court statement of the accused obtained without 
proper warnings. Until 1988, however, the state­
ments could not be used in California state courts 
on the theory that their use violated the California 
Constitution and thus the admissibility was 
decided by the state courts on "independent state 
grounds." 
Statutory Conflicts 
If the conflict is between a local ordinance and 
a state statute, then the local ordinance is void and 
without affect. For example, if there is a munici­
pal ordinance and state statute which penalizes the 
same conduct, the ordinance is void to the extent 
that it is not in harmony with the statute (Ex parte 
Solomon 91 C 440). Note: even if the ordinance is 
in harmony with the statute, it may be void based 
on the concept that the state has pre-empted the 
subject. 
If two general state statutes are in direct 
conflict with each other, the last statute enacted 
will be controlling based on the principle of repeal 
by implication. Repeal by implication is not a 
favored principle with the courts. Jfby reasonable 
construction both statutes can be given effect, 
then the courts will presume that the legislature 
intended that construction. As the court stated in 
People v. Armstrong (100 CA 2d Supp 852) it will 
be presumed that the legislature did not intend by 
a later act to repeal a former one if, by a fair and 
reasonable construction, effect can be given to 
both. Note: in situations involving repeal by 
implication, only that portion of the earlier statute 
which is in direct conflict with the latter statute is 
considered repealed. 

The Nature of Law 17 
2.5 Criminal and Civil Liability 
In general, the courts say that, if an act 
is merely a threat to private interest or 
offends it, then the act is only a civil 
wrong -not a crime. Because of our 
ideas of dual responsibility, (liability 
both for civil and criminal) the wrong­
doer may' 'be made to answer" in both 
a criminal prosecutionand in a civil 
lawsuit for damages. (Gammage & 
Hemphill-Basic Criminal Law) 
The basic difference between a civil law 
wrong and a crime is that the civil law wrong is a 
wrong against an individual, whereas, a crime is 
considered as a wrong against all of society. While 
the crime of assault may be directed toward an 
individual victim, the wrong is still considered 
against all of society. Civil cases are prosecuted by 
a plaintiff who is the person or persons alledgely 
injured by the alleged wrongful acts of the defen­
dant(s). Note: in the State of California, all crimes 
are prosecuted in the name of' 'The People of the 
State" and are alleged to be vi olations "against the 
peace and dignity of the state." 
Torts 
"Torts," a French word meaning wrong, is 
used to describe civil wrongs. Most torts involve 
either negligent conduct or intentional wrongs. 
Note: some conduct is both a civil tort and a 
criminal act. For example, if an individual 
assaults a victim, the individual has committed 
both the tortuous act of assault and the criminal 
act of assault. The individual may be prosecuted 
for the criminal act and, at the same time in a 
separate court case, sued by the victim in civil 
court for the tortuous conduct. 
In a civil case, the standard of proof required 
to establish a right to recovery is preponderance of 
proof whereas in a criminal case in order to 
convict an accused, the proof must be beyond a 
reasonable doubt. Preponderance of proof is a 
much lessor standard or requirement. This dif­
ference in standards can produce different results 
when the same issue is tried in both civil and 
criminal courts. For example, if a suspect is tried 
and acquitted of rape in a criminal court, he can 
still be sued by the victim in civil court for the tort of sexual assault. The fact that he was acquitted in 
criminal court is immaterial. If Gary pleads guilty 
to rape and admits that he committed the crime, 
however, his statement that he committed the acts 
necessary to establish the crime of rape could be 
used against him in civil court to help establish the 
tort. 
One major difference between civil and crimi­
nal trials is that in civil trials the defendant does 
not have the right to refuse to testify. Protection 
against unreasonable searches and seizures, also, 
do not apply in civil cases. In addition, the civil 
defendant is not provided with an attorney if he/ 
she can not afford one. 
In California, state civil cases are started by 
the plaintiff filing a complaint or petition in muni­
cipal Gustice court in rural areas) or superior 
court. If the amount in controversy is small, the 
complaint may be filed in the small claims divi­
sion of municipal or justice court. 
2.6 Doctrine of Judicial Review 
The doctrine of judicial review is an estab­
lished principle of law in the United States. This 
doctrine provides the courts with the authority to 
review all statutory enactments, judicial decisions 
of lower courts, and administrative determina­
tions within their jurisdiction. The principle, 
based on common law, was adopted by the U.S. 
Supreme Court in the famous case of Marbury v. 
Madison, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). In this case, Chief 
Justice John Marshall stated that it is the duty of 
the courts to say what the law is and that when the 
courts apply the rule to particular cases, they must 
of necessity expound and interpret that rule. The 
Chief Justice then stated that if two laws conflict, 
the courts must decide on the operation of each. 
Every state supreme court has accepted the princi­
pIes set forth by the Chief Justice in Marbury v. 
Madison. 
At the time that the decision was issued, 
Thomas Jefferson objected to the concept of judi­
cial review. In a letter in 1820, Jefferson stated" 
... to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters 
of all constitutional questions; a dangerous doc­
trine indeed, and one which would place us under 
the despotism of an oligarchy." He correctly 

18 Chapter 2 
pointed out that the concept of judicial review is 
not contained in our federal constitution. 
2.7 Jurisdiction and Venue 
U.S. Constitution, Amendment 6 
In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall 
enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an 
impartial jury of the State and district wherein the 
crime shall have been committed ... 
Penal Code 681 Legal Conviction Prerequisite 
to Pllnishment 
No person can be punished for a public 
offense, except upon a legal conviction in a court 
having jurisdiction thereof. 
Penal Code 777 Crimes in General 
Every person is liable to punishment by the 
laws of this State, for a public offense committed 
by him therein, except where it is by law cogniz­
able exclusively in the courts of the United States; 
and except as otherwise provided by law the 
jurisdiction of every public offense is in any 
competent court within the jurisdictional territory 
of which it is committed. 
Discussion 
Jurisdiction is the authority by which courts 
and judicial officers take cognizance of and decide 
cases. There are two types of jurisdiction; (1) of 
the subject matter and (2) of the person. Venue 
refers to the physical or geographical location of 
the court in which trial will be or has been tried. In 
the Penal Code, the term "territory jurisdiction" 
is used in place of the common law word "venue." 
In most cases, the two are considered as 
interchangeable. 
Jurisdiction 
Jurisdiction is the power of a court to try a 
case and to issue an order. Jurisdiction cannot be 
conferred by consent (Griggs v. Superior Court 16 
C 3d 341). Jurisdiction must be alleged in the 
accusatory pleadings (People v. Smith 231 CA 2d 
140). Jurisdiction may, however, be established by 
a preponderance of the evidence and circumstan­
tial evidence is sufficient to establish jurisdiction 
(People v. Cavanaugh 44 C 2d 252). The two 
important types of jurisdiction are "subject matter 
jurisdiction" and' 'jurisdiction over the person." Subject Matter Jurisdiction 
Subject matter jurisdiction refers to the power 
of a court to try the offense. There are three basic 
aspects to subject matter jurisdiction. These are: 
1. The offense in question must be one that 
the state has the power to prosecute. The 
power of a state to prosecute is restricted 
to the crimes that occur wholly within the 
stat», partially within the state or has an 
effect within the state. 
2. The court must be competent to try the 
crime. For example, a superior court has 
no jurisdiction over a case charging only 
misdemeanors in a county with a munici­
pal court (People v. Smith 231 CA 2d 140). 
3. If exclusive federal jurisdiction exists or 
the offense is only a federal crime, then a 
state court in California has no subject 
matter jurisdiction. 
Jurisdiction of Person 
Jurisdiction of the person is also a basic 
requirement in criminal proceedings. Presence in 
court usually establishes jurisdiction over the per­
son. In most cases, the defendant must be present 
at the start of his/her felony criminal trial. In 
misdemeanor cases, if the state takes personal 
jurisdiction over an accused by arresting or citing 
him/her to appear at a certain time and date, the 
failure of the accused to appear at the time set for 
trial can be considered as a waiver by the defen­
dant of his/her right to appear. 
Venue 
Normal venue of a criminal case is in the 
county and the district within which the crime was 
alleged to have been committed. A change of 
venue from a COUlt of one county to the same court 
in another county does not affect the latter court's 
jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case 
(People v Richardson 138 CA 404). 
Unlike subject matter jurisdiction, the parties 
to a trial can consent to venue. For example, by 
pleading guilty to the sale of a controlled sub­
stance, the accused admits every essential element 
of the crime charged except subject matter juris­
diction. (People v. Tabucchi 64 CA 3d 133). In this 
case, the accused plead guilty to a crime that was 

The Nature of Law 19 
alleged to have occurred in Stanislaus County. 
Later, he attempted to get the conviction reversed 
because the offense did not occur in Stanislaus 
County, therefore; he could not be tried by the 
Superior Court in that county. The California 
Supreme Court upheld his conviction. 
The general rules regarding the proper court 
for venue are: 
1. For crimes in general, in the county 
where the crime was committed (P C 
777). 
2. For nonsupport of child, in the county 
where the child is cared for or in the 
county where the parent is apprehended 
(P C 777a). 
3. For peljury committed outside of the 
state that is punishable in California, in 
the county where the proceeding was 
being conducted (p C 777b). Note: this 
situation would normally occur when a 
false document is made outside of the 
state to be used in court proceedings 
within the state. 
4. For offenses planned outside the state 
and committed within the state, in the 
county in which the offense is completed 
(p C 778). 
5. For offenses planned within the state and 
committed outside the state, in the 
county in which the offense was planned 
(P C 778a). 
6. For offenses committed in more than one 
venue, may be tried in any county in 
wI-.tich any of the acts were committed or 
effects of the crime were felt (p C 781). 
7. For offenses committed within 500 yards 
of any county boundary or on the bound­
ary line, in either county (p C 782). 
8. For offenses committed on trains, air­
planes, ships, motor vehicle in transit, in 
any county over which the vehicle trav­
eled in the course of u1.e trip (p C 783). 
9. Abduction, kidnaping and seduction, in 
any county in which the offense occurred 
or to which the victim was taken (P C 
784). 
10. For child concealment, in any county in which the child was taken, detained, con­
cealed, found, or whe:-:-e the victimized 
person resides or agency deprived of 
custody is located. 
11. For bringing or receiving stolen goods, in 
any county in which the goods were 
taken or received or in the county in 
which they were stolen (p C 786). 
12. For criminal homicide, in any county 
where the crime v'as committed or in the 
county in which the body was found. 
Establishing Venue 
Venue represents a question offact, and there­
fore must be alleged in the pleadings. This is 
normally accomplished by alleging that the 
offense occurred in X county. The burden of proof 
is on the prosecution to establish proper venue of 
the court. Failure of the prosecution to enter any 
evidence of venue in a "not guilty" case will cause 
the conviction to be overturned on appeal (People 
v. Pollock 26 CA 2d 602). The courts, however, 
can make reasonable inferences from the evidence 
to establish venue. For example, the accused was 
charged with robbing a service station in Fresno. 
The names of the streets where the station was 
located were entered into evidence, but not the 
city. The victim testified that he lived in Fresno 
and the Fresno Police Department investigated the 
robbery. The court, in upholding the conviction, 
stated that a reasonable inference was that the 
crime had occurred in the City of Fresno and that, 
venue unlike elements of the offense. is not 
required to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt 
(People v. Arline 13 CA 3d 200). 
Change of Venue 
While the accused has a right to be tried in the 
county where the crime occurred, often it is to the 
accused's advantage to be tried elsewhere. Most 
common reasons are that he/she will be unable to 
receive a fair trial in the local county or that trial 
in a different county will be more convenient, i.e. 
family and witnesses are located in a different 
county. The defense must request, by motion, 
prior to trial for a change of venue.

6. In Califomia, penal statutes are strictly 
construed. 
7. The codes of the state are to be considered as 
a single uni.fied whole. 
8. The U.S. Constitution is considered as the 
supreme law of the land. 
9. If a federal law conflicts with the California 
Constitution, the federal law must be 
unconstitutional. 
10. If there is a conflict between a local ordinance 
and a state statute, the last one passed 
controls. 
11. In a civil trial, the accused has a right to a 
government appointed counsel. 
12. Venue refers to the geographical or physical 
location of the court in which trial will be or 
has been tried. 
13. Subject matter jurisdiction requirement may 
be waived by the accused. 
14. The normal venue of a criminal ~<'lse is in the 
county where the crime occurred. 
15. For offenses committed in more than one 
county, the correct venue is in the county 
where most of the acts occurred.

Classification of Crimes 
No one is entirely useless. Even the worst o/us can serve as horrible 
examples. (Anonymous, in a state prison newspaper.) 
3.1 Distinction Between Felonies, Misde-
meanors and Infractions 
Penal Code 17 Felony and Misdemeanor 
Defined 
(a) A felony is a crime which is punishable 
with death or by imprisonment in the state prison. 
Every other crime or public offense is a misde­
meanor except those offenses that are classified as 
infractions. 
(b) When a crime is punishable, in the discre­
tion of the court, by imprisonment in the state 
prison or by fine or imprisonment in the county 
jail, it is a misdemeanor for all purposes under the 
following circumstances: 
(1) After a judgment imposing a punishment 
other than imprisonment in the state prison. 
(2) When the court, upon committing the 
defendant to the Youth Authority, designates the 
offense to be a misdemeanor. 
(3) When the court grants probation to a 
defendant without imposition of sentence and at 
the time of granting probation, or on application of 
the defendant or probation officer thereafter, the 
court declares the offense to be a misdemeanor. 
(4) When the prosecuting attorney files in a 
court having jurisdiction over misdemeanor 
offenses a complaint specifying that the offense is 
a misdemeanor, unless the defendant at the time of 
his arraignment or plea objects to the offense 
being made a misdemeanor, in which event the 
complaint shall be amended to charge a felony 
complaint. 
21 (5) When, at or before the preliminary exam­
ination or prior to filing an order pursuant to 
Section 872 [that section pertains to holding the 
accused over to answer for a felony], the magis­
trate detennines that the offense is a misde­
meanor, in which event the case shall proceed as if 
the defendant had been arraigned on a misde­
meanor complaint. 
(c) When a defendant is committed to the 
Youth Authority for a crime punishable, in the 
discretion of the court, by imprisonment in the 
state prison or by fine or imprisonment in county 
jail, the offense shall, upon the discharge of the 
defendant from the Youth Authority, thereafter be 
deemed a misdemeanor for all purposes. [Sub­
paragraph (d) omitted.] 
Penal Code 19.4 Public Offenses With No Pre­
scribed Penalty-Misdemeanor 
When an act or omission is declared by a 
statute to be a public offense, and no penalty for 
the offense is prescribed in any statute, the act or 
omission is punishable as a misdemeanor. 
Penal Code 19.7 Application of Misdemeanor Law 
to Infractions 
Except as otherwise provided by law, all 
provisions of law relating to misdemeanors shall 
apply to infractions, including but not limited to 
powers of peace officers, jurisdiction of courts, 
periods for commencing action and for bringing a 
case to trial and burden of proof. 

22 Chapter 3 
Discussion 
Crimes and public offenses are classified as 
felonies, misdemeanors or infractions. The high­
est and most serious crime in California is a 
felony. A felony is any crime that is punishable by 
death or imprisonment in a state prison. Next, in 
tenns of seriousness, is a misdemeanor. A misde­
meanor is a crime that is punishable by fine and/or 
imprisonment in a county jail for not more than 
one year. The lowest type of crime is an infraction. 
An infraction is a crime that is punishable only by 
a fine. (Note: a person charged only with an 
infraction is not entitled to ajury trial.) If a statute 
provides for imprisonment but does not specify 
the place of confinement, the crime is a misde­
meanor (Union Ice Co. v. Rose 11 CA 357). 
The label that the legislature affixes to a crime 
does not detennine its classification. The classi­
fication is based on the nature of the offense and 
its authorized punishment. In one case the statute 
deemed the act a felony, but only authorized 
punishment in the county jail and/or a fine. The 
court held that the offense was a misdemeanor not 
a felony (People v. Sacramento Brothers' Butchers' 
Protective Assoc. 12 CA 471). 
Wobblers 
In most cases, it is not the punishment 
awarded by a court that detennines whether or not 
a crime is a felony, misdemeanor or infraction; but 
the punishment that could have been imposed. 
There are some offenses, however, that are consid­
ered as "wobblers". Wobblers are offenses that are 
either felonies or misdemeanors depending on the 
sentences awarded at court or action by the court 
after conviction. Wobblers are treated as felonies 
until sentencing time unless the crimes are for­
mally charged as misdemeanors. 
For example, Penal Code 524 provides that an 
attempted extortion may be punished by imprison­
ment in the county jail or in a state prison. 
Accordingly, it is a "wobbler." If the accused on 
conviction receives a jail tenn, then it is a misde­
meanor conviction. If he or she receives a prison 
tenn, then it is a felony conviction. Note: the 
district attorney can charge it as a felony or 
misdemeanor. If the DA charges the offense as a felony offense, at the preliminary hearing the 
judge may reduce it to a misdemeanor offense. 
3.2 Punishments 
Penal Code 12 Duty to Determine and Impose 
Punishment 
The several sections of this code which 
declare certain crimes to be punishable as therein 
mentioned, devolve a duty upon the court autho­
rized to pass sentence, to detennine and impose 
the punishment prescribed. 
Penal Code 13 When Punishment Left 
Undetermined 
Whenever in this code the punishment for a 
crime is left undetennined between certain limits, 
the punishment to be inflicted in a particular case 
must be detennined by the court authorized to 
pass sentence, within such limits as may be pre­
scribed by this code. 
Penal Code 19.2 Confinement in County Jail Not 
to Exceed One Year 
In no case shall any person sentenced to 
confinement in a county or city jail ... except on 
the conviction of more than one offense when 
consecutive sentences have been imposed, be 
committed for a period in excess of one year; 
provided that the time allowed on parole shall not 
be considered as part of the period of 
confinement. 
Penal Code 19.6 Infractions Not Punishable by 
Imprisonment 
An infraction is not punishable by imprison­
ment. A person charged with an infraction shall 
not be entilled to a trial by jury ... [or] counsel· 
appointed at public expense .... 
Discussion 
When an act or omission is declared by a 
statute to be a crime and punishment is provided 
for, but no specific penalty is prescribed in the 
statute, then the general punishment statutes pre­
vail. In Califomia, even in jury trials, the judge 
has the duty to impose sentences. 
In capital cases with a jury, however, the jury 
must make a finding as to whether special circum­
stances exist and if so, do they outweigh the 
mitigating circumstances before the death penalty 

Classification of Crimes 23 
can be imposed. Note: there are 19 special circum­
stances listed in Penal Code 190.2 that permit the 
imposition of the death penalty. They are dis­
cussed in Chapter 9. For example, if the accused 
with no prior criminal record intentionally kills 
his girlfriend by administering poison, the jury 
must decide that the special circumstances (death 
by poisoning) outweigh the mitigating circum­
stances (no prior criminal record) before the death 
penalty may be imposed. 
Concurrently or Consecutively 
When the accused is convicted of two or more 
crimes, the judge is required to make a determina­
tion as to whether or not the sentences will be 
served concun'ently or consecutively. Sentences 
that are served concurrently are served at the same 
time. Consecutive sentences are served one at a 
time; one following the other. For example, the 
defendant is convicted of two crimes, arson and 
robbery. If he received two years for each offense 
and the sentences are served concurrently, he will 
serve a maximum of two years. If the sentences 
run consecutively, he will first serve one sentence 
and when that sentence is completed, then the 
other (two years plus two years for a maximum of 
four years). Note: if the accused has pending 
confinement from a previous court, the court 
should also indicate whether the present sentence 
will be served concurrently or consecutively with 
the sentence given in the prior court. 
Maximum Jail Term 
The maximum time that an accused may 
serve in a county jail on the conviction of one 
offense is one year. If, however, tlle accused is 
convicted of more than one offense and the sen­
tences are not served concurrently, the one year 
maximum time does not apply. 
Indeterminate Sentencing 
Indeterminate sentencing refers to those sit­
uations where the court does not fix a term of 
imprisonment as punishment. The sentence of 
imprisonment as awarded by the court, therefore, 
is an indeterminate one. In 1917, California 
adopted the Indeterminate Sentencing Act. The 
act divested the trial judge of the authority to fix 
the term of imprisonment for offenses punishable by imprisonment in a state prison. The power to 
fix the length of sentence was given to the Adult 
Authority, an administrative agency. The Indeter­
minate Sentencing Act was repealed in 1977 and 
applies now only to persons serving sentences for 
crimes committed period to July 1, 1977. 
Determinate Sentencing 
For offenses committed on or after July 1, 
1977, the Determinate Sentencing Act (p.C. 
1170-1170.95) applies. Under this act, if the court 
gives a sentence that includes confinement in a 
state prison, the court must fix a specified term of 
imprisonment. Note: the act also requires the 
judge under most circumstances to pronounce 
sentence within 28 days after a verdict of guilty or 
the acceptance of a guilty plea (P C 1191). (The 
accused may and often does waive this 28 day 
requirement.) 
If the statute specifies three possible terms of 
punishment, the court shall order imposition of 
the middle term (often referred to as "mid­
term' '), unless there are circumstances in aggrava­
tion or mitigation of the crime (P C 1170). For 
example, the stated penalty for extortion is 
imprisonment in a state prison for two, three or 
four years (P C 520). The "mid-term is three 
years. If this is the first offense, the court will 
probably impose only the two year term (the 
"mitigated tenn' '). If the offense is an aggravated 
one, the court may impose the four year term (the 
"aggravated term"). Aggravated factors include 
harm or hardship imposed on victim, prior record 
of the accused, etc. 
The general objectives of punishment in Cal­
ifornia under the Determinate Sentencing Act 
include (Judicial Council, Rules of Court, Rule 
410): 
1. Protecting society 
2. Punishing the defendant. 
3. Encouraging the defendant to lead a law 
abiding life in the future. 
4. Deterring others from criminal conduct 
by demonstrating its consequences. 
5. Preventing the defendant from committing 
new crimes by isolating him for the period 
of incarceration. 

24 Chapter 3 
6. Securing restitution for the victims of 
crime. 
7. Achieving uniformity in sentencing. 
3.3 Prior Convictions 
Prior convictions have three main effects on 
the sentences given by the courts: 
1. Establish certain minimum penalties. 
2. Provide for increased sentences. 
3. May provide for the adjudication of the 
accused as a habitual criminal. 
Prior convictions are considered as punish­
ment •• enhancements," referring to their effects 
on the punishments given by the courts. (Note: 
there are other enhancements contained in the 
Penal Code such as the use of a gun in committing 
a crime.) The enhancements based on prior con­
victions are found in P C 666 through P C 668. 
The general provisions ofP C 668 permit the use 
of convictions in other states subject to certain 
limitations as a sentence enhancement. 
3.4 Lesser and Included Offenses 
Penal Code 1159 Conviction of Offense Included 
in Charge 
The jury, or the judge if a jury trial is waived, 
may find the defendant guilty of any offense, the 
commission of which is necessarily included in 
that with which he is charged, or of an attempt to 
commit the offense. 
Discussion 
As stated in the above code, the defendant 
may be convicted of any offense, the commission 
of which is necessarily included in the crime with 
which he/she was charged. A defendant, however, 
can not be convicted of an included offense which 
is barred by the statute of limitations, even if the 
statute has not expired for the greater offense 
charged (People v. Miller 12 C 291). If the defen­
dant is charged with two offenses in separate 
counts and one is necessarily included in the 
other, he/she can not be sentenced for both (People 
v. Sutton 35 CA 3d 264). For example, assault is a 
necessarily included offense to battery. Accord­
ingly, for one act that amounts to a battery, the 
accused may not be sentenced for both the assault 
(which is included in the battery) and the battery. Test For Lesser and Included Offense 
The test to determine if one offense is a 
necessarily included offense of another is that 
when one offense cannot be committed without 
committing the other offense, then the latter 
offense is a necessarily included offense. For 
example, an accused could not be convicted of 
both an assault and a battery for the same act of 
striking a victim in the face with his fist. The 
assault is a necessarily included offense of the 
battery. It is not an included offense if additional 
evidence is required to convict the accused of the 
lessor offense. For example, speeding is not a 
necessarily included offense of driving under the 
influence, because an individual may be driving 
under the influence without exceeding the speed 
limit. Note: a single act may violate two separate 
statutes and therefore constitute two separate 
crimes. For example, the accused may be speed­
ing and also driving under the influence. The act 
of driving, therefore, constitutes two separate 
crimes. 
3.5 Double JeOpardy 
U. S. Constitution, Amendment 5 [partial] 
[N]or shall any person be subject for the same 
offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or 
limb .... 
Constitution of the State of California, Article 
I, Section 15 [partial] 
Persons may not twice be put in jeopardy for 
the same offense. 
Definition 
The constitutional guarantee against double 
jeopardy involves three separate protections: 
1. Protecting an accused from being pros­
ecuted for the same offense after acquittal. 
2. Protecting an accused from being pros­
ecuted for the same offense after 
conviction. 
3. Protecting an accused from multiple 
punishments for the same criminal con­
duct. (United States v. Di Francesco 449 U 
S 117) 

Classification of Crimes 25 
Discussion 
The underlying idea, one that is deeply 
ingrained in at least the Anglo-Ameri­
can system of jurisprudence, is that the 
State with all of its resources and 
power should not be allowed to make 
repeated attempts to convict an individ­
ual for an alleged offense, thereby sub­
jecting him to embarrassment, 
expense and ordeal and compelling 
him to live in a continuing state of 
anxiety and insecurity, as well as 
enhancing the possibility that even 
though innocent he may be found 
guilty (Green v. United States 355 US 
184). 
The purpose of the doctrine is to protect an 
accused from the harassment of multiple trials. 
Accordingly, to be placed in jeopardy for a second 
time, the accused must be placed on trial for a 
second time (People v. Thomas 121 CA 2d 754). 
Double jeopardy does not apply where the trial is 
bifurcated (separated into two separate proceed­
ings) by the defendant who enters both "not 
guilty" and "not guilty by reason of insanity" 
pleas (People v. Coen 205 C 596). 
Identity of Offenses 
For double jeopardy to apply, the prosecution 
must be for the same offense as that involved in the 
earlier proceedings. For purposes of double 
jeopardy, offenses are considered the same if one 
is necessarily included in the other. 
Waiver 
Since double jeopardy is not a jurisdictional 
issue, the accused must assert the bar against 
prosecution. The double jeopardy bar is regarded 
as waived unless the defense raises it during 
pleading. If the defense is asserted, the defense 
has the burden to establish the validity of the 
former jeopardy claim (People v. Eggleston 255 
CA 2d 337). 
Double jeopardy as a bar to prosecution must 
be specifically pleaded in the form prescribed by 
the Penal Code. The pleas must indicate the time, 
place and court of the alleged former jeopardy. A general plea of not guilty does not raise the issue 
(People v. Barry 153 CA 2d 193). 
Different Crimes 
If the same act is made punishable by different 
provisions of the California statutes, it may be 
punished under any of them. In no case, however~ 
may the accused be punished under more than 
one, and an acquittal or conviction and sentence 
under one bars (prevents) the prosecution under 
another provision (People v. Manago 230 CA 2d 
645). Note: if either crime requires the proof of a 
different fact additional to those involved in the 
other, there is no double jeopardy (People v. Col­
trin,5 C 2d 649). For example, the accused may 
be charged with the possession of an illegal fire­
arm and robbery involving the use of a firearm. 
This is based on the fact that to establish robbery, 
additional facts are needed other than the posses­
sion of a firearm. In addition, to establish illegal 
possession of a firearm, the prosecution must 
establish that possession of the weapon was ille­
gal; a fact that is not required for the robbery 
charge. A defendant's conviction for reckless driv­
ing did not prevent the state from trying him for 
manslaughter committed by the same conduct 
since different elements were required to be estab­
lished for each crime (People v. Herbert 6 C2d 541) 
Res Judicata 
Double jeopardy is not the same as "res 
judicata. ,. Res judicata. a Latin phrase meaning 
"stands decided, " is based on a final adjudication 
of the same issue involving the same parties to the 
trial. Double jeopardy attaches in most cases prior 
to final adjudication and unlike "res judicata" is a 
constitutionally protected right. In addition, "res 
judicata" applies also to civil proceedings, 
whereas double jeopardy, applies only to criminal 
cases. 
Protection against double jeopardy does not 
apply to civil or administrative proceedings. 
Accordingly, a gun owner's acquittal on criminal 
charges involving firearms does not bar a subse­
quent prosecution in forfeiture proceedings (civil 
action) against the firearms (U.S. v. One Assort­
ment of Firearms 79 L Ed 2d 361). Note: res 
judicata did not apply because there are different 
parties involved. In the criminal case, the accused 1 

26 Chapter 3 
was the principal party and in the civil case being 
"in rem" the case was against the guns. (' 'In rem" 
proceedings refers to the fact that the action in the 
case is against an object, not a person.) 
Attachment of Jeopardy 
As noted above, double jeopardy does not 
apply unless the accused has previously been put 
in jeopardy. Listed below are some of the cases 
involving the question of whether or not the 
accused has been placed in jeopardy: 
1. he accused is acquitted based on a vari­
ance between the pleading and the evi­
dence entered at trial. No double jeopardy 
if the acquittal is based on mere variance 
rather than on an entire want of evidence. 
This is based on the concept that since he 
could not be convicted on the pleadings, 
he never was in jeopardy. If the variance, 
however, is immaterial and the accused 
could have been convicted, then the dou­
ble jeopardy bar would apply (People v. 
Webb 38 C 467) 
2. Jeopardy attaches in ajury case, when the 
jury has been impaneled and sworn (Peo­
ple v. Hinshaw 194 C 1). 
3. Jeopardy attaches in a judge alone case, 
when the trial has been "entered upon" 
(People v. Beasley 5 CA 3d 617). A trial 
has been "entered upon" when either the 
first witness is sworn or evidence is 
entered against the accused. 
4. Jeopardy does not attach if the pleading 
are invalid (People v. Webb 38 C 467). 
After Jeopardy Attaches 
In certain situations, the accused may be tried 
again even if jeopardy has attached. Listed below 
are some common situations involving the ques., 
tion of whether or not the accused may be tried a 
second time. 
1. A double jeopardy bar prevented prosecu­
tion when the first case was dismissed 
after the jury was sworn without the con­
sent of the accused and when not autho­
rized by law (Cardenas v. Superior Court 
56 C2d 273). 
2. Discharge of the jury prior to the jury 
rendering a verdict without the consent of the accused and not required by law is 
tantamount to an acquittal and bars a 
retrial (People v. Webb 38 C 467). 
3. A mistrial granted on motion of the 
defense is not a bar to a second trial. A 
mistrial, however, granted by the court to 
protect the rights of the accused is a bar to 
a second trial unless the accused consents 
to the mistrial or a mistrial is required by 
the law (People v. McNeer 8 CA 2d 676). 
4. A mistrial granted when the jury is unable 
to reach a verdict is within the discretion 
of the judge and absent abuse of discretion 
by the judge, it is not a bar to a second trial 
(Curry v. Superior Court 2 C 3d 707 and P 
C 1140). 
5. A mistrial granted where because of sick­
ness of a jury member or an accident 
prevents the jury from reaching a verdict is 
not a bar to a second trial (P C 1141). 
6. A mistrial granted on motion of the defen­
dant is no bar to a second prosecution 
(Oregon v. Kennedy 456 U S 667). When 
an accused requests a mistrial or appeals a 
court judgment, the motion or appeal is 
considered as a waiver of the double 
jeopardy bar. The one exception to this 
rule is when the conviction is reversed on 
appeal based on insufficient evidence to 
support the conviction as a matter of law. 
In this latter case, double jeopardy protec­
tion is a bar to retrial (Burks v. U.S. 437 U 
S 1). 
7. The double jeopardy protection prevents 
the state from appealing an acquittal. If, 
however, the state successfully appeals a 
court order dismissing an indictment or 
information prior to jeopardy attaching, 
the accused may be re-tried (People v. Petti 
149 CA 3d 1). 
Dual Sovereignty Doctrine 
Dual sovereignty doctrine applies when the 
same conduct constitutes crimes against more 
than one state or the federal government. In these 
situations, the accused has violated the criminal 
statutes of two different sovereigns (normally 
state and federal) and therefore he/she may be 
tried by both governments. For example, robbing 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Classification of Crimes 27 
a federally insured bank in the state is a violation 
of both state and federal law and the accused may 
be prosecuted by both. Note: the restrictions 
imposed in California by Penal Code 794 (dis­
cussed below). 
Statutory Bar 
"Statutory Bar" is a phrase sometimes used 
by the courts if the bar to prosecution is created by 
statute and not by constitution. There are several 
provisions in the Penal Code which bar prosecu­
tion in cases where the constitutional protection of 
double jeopardy does not. For example, Penal 
Code 794 provides that when an act is also a 
criminal act in another state or country, the acquit­
tal by a court in the other state or country will bar 
prosecution in the State of California. 
3.6 Statute of Limitations 
Penal Code 799 No Limitation for 
Commencement of Prosecution 
Prosecution for an offense punishable by 
death or imprisonment in the state prison for life 
or for life without the possibility of parole, or for 
the embezzlement of public money, may be com­
menced at any time. 
Penal Code 800 Six-Year Limitations 
Except as provided in Section 799, prosecu­
tion for an offense punishable by imprisonment in 
the state prison for eight years or more shall be 
commenced wi thin six years after the commission 
of the offense. 
Penal Code 801 Three-Year Limitation 
Except as provided in Sections 799 and 800, 
prosecution for an offense punishable by 
imprisonment in the state prison shall be com­
menced within three years after commission of the 
offense. [A felony] 
Penal Code 801.5 Three-Year Limitation -
Fraudulent Insurance Claims 
Notwithstanding Section 801 or any other 
provision of the law, prosecution for a violation of 
Section 556 of the Insurance Code shall be com­
menced within three years after discovery of the 
commission of the offense. Penal Code 802 One Year Limitation; 
Exceptions 
(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), 
prosecution for an offense not punishable by death 
or imprisonment in the state prison shall be com­
menced within one year after commission of the 
offense. [A misdemeanor.] 
(b) Prosecution for a misdemeanor violation 
of Section 647.6 or former Sec'uon 647a [those 
sections pertain to misdemeanor child molesters, 
i.e. annoying or molesting a child under circum­
stances not amounting to a felony], committed 
with or upon a minor under the age of 14, shall be 
commenced within two years aftger the commis­
sion of the offense. 
Penal Code 804 When ·Prosecution for an 
Offense is Commenced 
For the purpose of this chapter, prosecution 
for an offense is commenced when any of the 
following occurs: 
(a) an indictment or infonnation is filed. 
(b) A compliant is filed with an inferior court 
charging a public offense of which the inferior 
court has original trial jUrisdiction. 
(c) A case is certified to the superior court. 
(d) An arrest warrant or bench warrant is 
issued, provided the warrant names or describes 
the defendant with the same degree of par­
ticularity required for an indictment, information, 
or complaint. 
Definition 
The statute oflimitations sets forth the period 
of time after the commission of the crime within 
which prosecution against the accnsed must be 
started. Failure to start the prosecution within the 
required time period acts as a "bar" to prosecu­
tion. Note: as indicated in PC 799, some crimes 
like murder have no statute of limitations. 
Discussion 
The statute oflimitations requires that crimi­
nal prosecutions commence within a certain 
period oftime after the crime occurred. There are 
time periods, however, which are excluded in 
determining whether or not prosecution was 
started within the required time. The excluded 
time periods are noted below. The statute of 
limitations is a jurisdictional requirement. 

I ~ 28 Chapter 3 
Accordingly, failure to begin prosecution within 
the required time bars the state from prosecuting 
the accused (People v. Doctor 257 CA 2d 105). In 
addition, the accused may assert the bar oflimita­
tions at any time during the trial (People v. Witt 53 
CA 3d 154). 
Offenses with a six-year statute oflimitations 
include: 
1. Rape (P C 261) 
2. Child molesting (p C 288) 
3. Sodomy by force or fear (P C 286d) 
4. Oral copulation by force or fear (P C 288a) 
Offenses with a three year statute of limita-
tions include: 
1. Grand theft (p C 487) 
2. Felony welfare fraud (W & I 11483) 
3. Forgery (P C 470) 
4. Manslaughter (p C 192.1 or .2) 
5. PeIjury (p C 118) 
Note: there is no statute of limitations for 
murder, embezzlement of public money, and kid­
napping for ransom. 
Prosecution, for statute of limitations pur­
poses, is normally started with an arrest of the 
defendant on a warrant or the filing of a sworn 
information, complaint, or indictment. The infor­
mation, complaint, or indictment must indicate on 
its "face" that the statute has not expired (ranout). 
This requirement is normally accomplished by 
pleading the date on which the offense occurred. 
By looking at that date and the date on which the 
information or indictment was fIled is normally 
sufficient to indicate that the statute of limitations 
does not bar prosecution. When the pleadings are 
sufficient, then the question as to whether the 
statute of limitations bars prosecution is an evi­
dentiary question for the courts to decide (People 
v. Padfield 136 CA 3d 218). 
Time is computed by excluding the first day 
(date the crime was committed) and including the 
last (when prosecution starts) (People v. Twedt 1 C 
2d 392). In the case of a continuing offense, the 
last day that the offense was committed or con­
tinued is the date used as the first day. 
There are certain periods of time are that are 
excluded in computing the statute of limitations. The term used is that the statute of limitations is 
"tolled" during that period of time. Listed below 
are the most common events that either tolls or 
delays the running of the statute of limitations: 
1. During the period of time that the accused 
is absent from the jurisdiction of the state 
(for a maximum of three years) (P C 
803(e). Note: the absence may be estab­
lished by circumstantial evidence such as 
a fruitless search for the defendant (People 
v. McGill 10 CA 2d 159). 
2. In many cases, the statute of limitations 
does not start until the discovery of the 
offense or when it should have been dis­
covered (P C 803). 
3. During the period of time that the accused 
is being prosecuted or prosecution is pend­
ing for the same conduct in any California 
state court (P C 803 (b». For example, the 
defendant is charged with the commission 
of an offense within the time period. If all 
charges are later dismissed, the period of 
time that the charges were pending is 
excluded in computing the time period. 
If the defendant is accused of an offense for 
which the statute does not bar prosecution, he/she 
cannot be convicted of a lessor included offense 
for which the statute does bar prosecution. For 
example, in People v. Rose (28 CA 3d 415) the 
defendant was indicted for murder many years 
after the crime was committed. (Note: there is no 
limitation period for this offense.) The court held 
that he could not be convicted of manslaughter (a 
lessor included offense) because the statute of 
limitations barred prosecution for the manslaugh­
ter charge. Note: a court, however, held in one case 
that an accused could be convicted of conspiracy 
to commit a misdemeanor (a felony) even though 
the statute of limitations barred prosecution on the 
subject misdemeanor (People v. LilUock 265 CA 
2d 419). 
Modification of Statute of Limitations 
If the statute of limitations bars the prosecu­
tion of a crime, the later modification of the statute 
does not extend the period of time to prosecution. 
If, however, the statute of limitations does not 
presently bai prosecution, the legislature may 

Classification of Crimes 29 
extend it for previously committed crimes (Sobiek 
v. Superior Court 28 CA 3d 846). In that case, the 
accused was charged with forgery committed 
before the legislature extended the statute of lim­
itations. The court stated that the legislature could 
extend a still operative period of limitations but 
could not revive a period that has already expired.

Chapter 4 
Corpus Delicti and Capacity 
The first prison I ever saw had inscribed on it: "Cease to do evil: 
learn to d~ well." The inscription, however, was on the outside of 
the wall, and the prisoners could not read it. (George Bernard Shaw 
-On Imprisonment) 
4.1 Role of Corpus Delicti 
Corpus delicti literally means "the body of 
the crime." Corpus delicti of a criminal offense is 
the required elements of the crime. A person, 
therefore, cannot be convicted of a crime unless 
the prosecution establishes the corpus delicti, i.e. 
that a crime has been committed, 
Identity of the offender is not an essential 
element of corpus delicti. To successfully pros­
ecute, however, the prosecution must establish 
that the accused was the one who committed all 
the elements of the crime. Note: corpus delicti can 
not be established solely from the confessions of 
the accused. There must be other independent 
evidence to establish that the crime did occur (In 
re Robert P. 121 CA 3d 36). 
4.2 Act and Intent 
Penal Code 20 Unity of Act and Intent or 
Negligence 
In every crime or public offense there must 
exist a union, or joint operation of act and intent, 
or criminal negligence. 
Discussion 
In order to constitute criminal conduct, there 
must be a unity in time of the act and the intent or 
criminal negligence. A frequently used equation 
to illustrate this is: Crime· Criminal Act (or 
actus reus)· Criminal Intent (or mens rea). Both 
31 the act and the intent must be joined together in 
time for at least a brief period. For example, 
burglary requires the entering of a building with 
the intent to commit larceny or a felony therein. In 
order to be burglary, the accused must have had 
the intent to commit either larceny or a felony 
therein at the time of the entry. Accordingly, if the 
accused enters a room and after entry, fonns the 
intent to steal, he or she may be guilty of larceny 
but not burglary since the intent (to steal) and the 
act (entry) were not connected in time. 
Criminal Act 
Criminal acts are usually affinnative and vol­
untary acts of the defendants. Criminal acts, 
however, may be: 
1. Verbal acts or words as in peIjury. 
2. A failure to act when there is a duty to act. 
3. The act of agreement in a conspiracy. 
4. The act of possession in crimes involving 
illegal possession. 
Passive Participation 
Passive participation is where a person allows 
an act to occur but no active act is involved. In 
cases where the passive individual has a duty to 
act, passive participation is sufficient to constitute 
the criminal act. For example, a mother who fails 
to feed her infant resulting in death to the infant 
has committed a criminal act. The security guard 
who deliberately al10ws company materials to be 

32 Chapter 4 
stolen may be a passive participate in the crime. 
Note: mere presence at the scene of a crime and 
failure to take steps to prevent it is not normally 
criminal conduct (People v. Vernon 89 CA 3d 853). 
4.3 Intent 
Penal Code 21 Intent Manifested by 
Circumstances 
(a) The intent or intention is manifested by the 
circumstances connected with the offense. 
(b) In the guilt phase of a criminal action or a 
juvenile adjudication hearing. evidence that the 
accused lacked the capacity or ability to control 
his conduct for any reason shall not be admissi.ble 
on the issue of whether the accused actually had 
any mental state with respect to the commission of 
any crime. This subdivision is not applicable to 
Section 26. [Section 26 deals with persons incapa­
ble of committing crime.] 
Discussion 
There are two general types of intent used in 
criminal law; specific intent and general criminal 
intent. The legislature determines the type of 
intent required for the commission of a particular 
crime. If the language of the statute is unclear as to 
the type of intent required for conviction, often the 
courts look to common law for guidance. In the 
trial of the case, the presence or absence of the 
required intent is a question of fact. The trial 
court's determination as to the presence or 
absence of the required intent, if based on sub­
stantial evidence, will not be disturbed on appeal 
(People v. Armstrong l()() CA 2d Supp 852). 
The Penal Code provides that intent is man­
ifested by the circumstances connected with the 
offense. Note: certain persons are considered as 
incapable of committing certain crimes because of 
a lack of requisite mental state e.g. very young 
children and insane persons. The lack of capacity 
to commit a crime is discussed later in this 
chapter. 
General Intent 
General intent is the intent that is inferred by 
the doing of an act or the failure to act. To 
constitute general criminal intent, it is not neces­
sary that there should exist an intent to violate the 
law (People v. Williams 102 CA 3d 1018). In general intent crimes, there is no requirement to 
establish that the accused knew his/her act was 
wrongful. All that is necessary is that the act was 
done volitionally or will:fully. For example, driv­
ing 55 m.p.h. in a school zone is a crime. It does 
not matter that the accused was unaware that he 
was in a school zone or the fact that his speedome­
ter was broken which prevented him from know­
ing that he was driving in excess of the speed 
limit. To successfully prosecute, the state would 
need only to establish that the accused was 
willfully driving, and his speed was in excess of 
the legal limit. 
Specific Intent 
Some crimes require more than a general 
criminal intent. To commit a specific intent crim e, 
the accused must have contemplated the ultimate 
act (People v. Armentrout 118 CA Supp 761). For 
example, larceny is a specific intent crime. Before 
an accused can be convicted of larceny, the state 
must establish that he/she had a specific intent to 
steal at the time that the property was taken. For 
example, Jerry leaving a restaurant sees a coat that 
looks like his. Thinking that the coat is his, he 
takes it. Even though the taking of the coat was 
wrong, he is not guUty oflarceny (a specific intent 
crime) since there was no specific intent to steal 
the coat. 
The California Supreme Court discussed the 
differences between general and specific intent in 
People v. Hood (1 C 3d 857). The Court stated: 
"When the definition of a crime consists of only 
the description of a particular act, without refer­
ence to intent to do a further act or achieve a future 
consequence, we ask whether the defendant 
intended to do the proscribed act. This intention is 
deemed to be a general criminal intent. When the 
definition refers to defendant's intent to do some 
further act or achieve some additional conse­
quence, the crime is deemed to be one of specific 
intent. There is no real difference, however, only a 
linguistic one, between an intent to do an act 
already performed and intent to do that same act in 
the future." 
Transferred Intent 
Transferred intent, also referred to as 
constructive intent, applies where there is a dif­
ference between the criminal act intended and the 

Corpus Delicti and Capacity 33 
act actually committed. For example, a person 
intending to kill one person by mistake kills 
another. In this case, the doctrine of transferred 
intent would be used to imply a willful killing of 
the actual victim (People v. Buenaflore 40 CA 2d 
713). The doctrine of transferred intent is most 
often applied to murder and assault with the intent 
to kill cases. 
As one judge stated (Gladden v. State 273 Md. 
383), "The fact that the person actually killed was 
killed instead of the intended victim is immaterial, 
and the only question is what would have been the 
degree of guilt if the result intended had actually 
been accomplished. The intent is transferred to 
the person whose death has been caused." 
4.4 Criminal Negligence 
Negligent conduct in some situations con­
stitutes criminal behavior. In those cases, the 
negligent conduct is a substitute for criminal 
intent. To determine whether or not the negligent 
conduct is sufficient to replace criminal intent, the 
following rules apply: 
1. Negligence is not a substitute for specific 
intent (People v. Becker 94 CA 2d 434). 
(Note: specific intent is discussed later in 
this chapter.) 
2. Negligence must amount to a "gross" or 
"culpable" departure from the standard of 
due care. Mere simple negligence is not 
sufficient (People v. Penny 44 C 2d 861). 
To be criminal, the negligent conduct 
must show an indifference t.o the con­
sequences, and require knowledge, actual 
or implied, that the conduct tends to 
endanger another's life (People v. Peabody 
46 CA 3d 43). 
3. Whether or not the negligent conduct is 
criminal must be determined from the 
~onduct itself and not from the resultant 
harm (People v. Brain 110 CA 3d Supp 1). 
4. What obligation or responsibility does the 
defendant have toward proper conduct? 
5. What is the standard of proper conduct 
expected of an ordinary, reasonable, pru­
dent person under the same conditions? 
6. What standard of conduct was violated? 7. There must be a direct connection between 
the negligent conduct and the injury or 
harm. 
8. There must be injury or harm resulting 
from the negligent conduct. 
4.5 Proximate Cause 
Causation problems normally arise in crimi­
nallaw only in those offenses involving homicide. 
As in tort law, to be legally responsible for the 
injury, death or other harm which constitutes the 
crime; the defendant's act must be the proximate 
cause of it. Proximate cause (also called "legally 
responsible cause") is established where the act is 
directly connected with the resulting injury, and 
there are no intervening independent forces 
(Witkin, California Crimes, Section 78-80). If 
there are no other concurrent or contributing 
causes, normally it is immaterial that the results 
were not reasonably foreseeable. 
Concurrent or Contributing Cause 
In some cases, the defendant is criminally 
liable for the results of his/her act, even though 
there is another contributing cause (People v. 
Lewis 124 C 551). For example, the accused shoots 
the victim. The victim dies as the results of 
negligent medical treatment. The accused may be 
guilty of criminal homicide. In this case, the 
accused could reasonable foresee that a victim 
may receive less than adequate medical treatment. 
If the intervening cause is so disconnected 
and unforeseeable, the defendant's act will not be 
considered as the proximate cause. For example, 
the defendant steals a car of the victim. The 
victim, then borrows his son's car. The victim is 
killed in a car wreck because of faulty brakes on 
the son's car. In this case, the defendant cannot be 
convicted of criminal homicide because the 
results are so disconnected and unforeseeable. 
4.6 Strict Liability/ Crimes Without Intent 
Under many statutes enacted for the 
protection of the public health and 
safety, e.g. trafficand food and drug 
regulations, criminal sanctions are 
relied upon even if there is no wrongful 
intent. These offenses usually involve 
-----------------------_._-------------------

34 Chapter 4 
light penalties and no moral obloquy or 
damage to reputation. Although crimi­
nal sanctions are relied upon, the pri­
mary purpose of the statutes is 
regulation rather than punishment or 
correction. The offenses are not crimes 
in the orthodox sense, and wrongful 
intent is not required in the interest of 
enforcement. (People v. Vogel 46 C 2d 
798) 
For certain criminal acts, the defendant may 
be punished without proof of any criminal intent. 
These offenses normally are public welfare 
offenses and generally deal with sales of food, 
beverages and drugs. The most common of the 
absolute liability crimes are: 
1. illegal sale of liquor. 
2. Sale of impure or adulterated food. 
3. Violation of vehicle registration 
requirements. 
4. Sale of misbranded merchandise. 
5. Violation of sanitary regulations. 
6. Sale of adulterat('.d drugs. 
7. Sale of illegally subdivided land. 
8. Failure to file state income tax return. 
4.7 Capacity to Commit a Crime 
Penal Code 26 Persons Capable of Committing 
Crime 
All persons are capable of committing crimes 
except those belonging to the following classes: 
One -Children under the age of 14, in the 
absence of clear proof that at the time of commit­
ting the act charged against them, they knew its 
wrongfulness. 
Two-Idiots. 
Three -Persons who committed the act or 
made the omission charged under an ignorance or 
mistake of fact, which disproves any criminal 
intent. 
Four -Persons who committed the act 
charged without being conscious thereof. 
Five -Persons who committed the act or 
made the omission charged through misfortune or 
by accident, when it appears that there was no evil 
design, intention, or culpable negligence. 
Six-Persons (unless the crime be punishable 
with death) who committed the act or made the omission under threats or menaces sufficient to 
show that they had reasonable cause to and did 
believe their lives would be endangered if they 
refused. 
Discussion 
All persons are presumed to have the ability to 
commit crimes except those listed above in sec­
tion 26 of the code. 
Children 
The age referred in Section 26 (above) is 
chronological age not mental or moral age. This 
section creates a rebuttable presumption that a 
child under the age of 14 is incapable of commit­
ting a criminal offense (In re Gladys R. 1 C3d 
855). The "clear proof' standard is the same as 
"clear and convincing evidence" (/ n re Michael B. 
149 CA 3d 1073). Note: juvenile court has primary 
jurisdiction over youths under the age of 18 who 
commit criminal offenses. 
If appropriate, the juvenile court may refer the 
case to adult criminal court (W & I Code 707). 
The criteria used to determine if the case should 
be referred to adult criminal court are: 
1. The degree of criminal sophistication 
exhibited by the minor. 
2. Whether the minor can be rehabilitated 
prior to the expiration of the juvenile 
court's jurisdiction. 
3. The minor's previous delinquent histo.ry. 
4. Success of previous attempts by the juve­
nile court to rehabilitate the minor. 
5. The circumstances and gravity of the 
offense alleged to have been committed by 
the minor. 
Idiots 
An idiot is a person who is totally without 
understanding or mentality. An idiot does not 
know right from wrong, and therefore does not 
realize the nature of his/her wrongful act. (Note: 
insanity is discussed later in this chapter.) 
Mistake of Fact 
The mistake referred to under' 'three," above, 
is a mistake of fact, not of law. A mistake of law 
(ignorance) is not normally an excuse for commit­
ting a criminal act. For example, the accused takes 

I Corpus Delicti and Capacity 35 
someone else's coat by mistake. He/she is not 
guilty of larceny (mistake of fact). The accused 
thinking that the speed limit is 55 mph drives 50 
mph in a 40 mph zone. No excuse, since this is not 
a mistake of fact. In the latter situation, the 
accused is mistaken as to the legal speed limit, i.e. 
the law. Ignorance was not a defense in the case 
involving a nurse in charge of a private hospital 
who thought she had the authority to possess 
narcotics (People v. Marschalk206 CA 2d 346). A 
mistake of law is no excuse even where based on 
advise of an attorney (People v. Flumerjelt 35 CA 
2d 495). 
For specific intent crimes and those crimes 
that require a special mental element, normally an 
"honest" mistake of fact is sufficient if the mis­
take negates the specific intent or special mental 
element (People v. Navarro 99 CA 2d Supp 1). For 
general intent crimes, in most cases an "honest 
and reasonable" mistake of fact is required to 
excuse criminal liability (Re Application oj Ahart 
172 C 762). 
Accident/Misfortune 
If the act causing the injury or harm was 
committed by accident or misfortune not involv­
ing criminal negligence, the injury or harm is 
considered to be Ie an act of God," and the actor is 
not criminally responsible for the resultant harm. 
"Public safety" crimes, discussed later in this 
chapter, are an exception to this general rule. An 
example of an accident would be where an auto­
mobile driver is driving with normal caution and 
not speeding when a young child darts out from 
between two parked cars. If the driver, without 
being at fault, hits the child, the resulting injury 
would be considered as "an act of God." The 
driver would not be criminally at fault for the 
injury. 
Unconsciousness 
Subdivision Five refers to persons who would 
otherwise have sufficient capacity but are incapa­
ble of committing criminal acts because of som­
nambulists, or persons suffering with delirium 
from fever or drugs (People v. Methever 132 C 
326). For example, a person may defend a murder 
accusation based on unconsciousness following a 
blow to the head by the assailant (People v. Cox 67 CA 2d 166). A criminal act committed while a 
person is "[;leep walking" (somnambulism) is 
covered by this subdivision. Unconsciousness is a 
complete defense to the crime. It does not, 
however, include mental illness. 
The Subdivision does not cover insanity or 
voluntary intoxication (People v. Taylor 31 CA 2d 
723). If the voluntary intoxication, over a period 
oftime, causes permanent brain damage, the issue 
of insanity may be present. (See discussion on 
insanity later in this chapter.) 
Involuntary intoxication, however, appears to 
be covered by this subdivision. Involuntary intox­
ication exists when a person becomes intoxicated 
by taking a substance or drink without realizing 
that the substance or drink contains alcohol or 
drugs. The defendant in People v. Velez (175 CA 3d 
785) could not use the defense of unconsciousness 
as the result of involuntary intoxication based on 
the fact that he did not know the marijuana he was 
smoking was laced with PCP. The court stated that 
the defendant's act of smoking the marijuana, an 
intoxicating substance, prevented him from rais­
ing the unconsciousness defense. 
Duress 
If the defendant committed the criminal act 
under duress, the duress may be a complete 
defense. For duress under Subdivision Six to con­
stitute a defense, there must be: 
1. a reasonable and 
2. actual belief 
3. that a life is in danger or serious bodily 
injury is threatened, and 
4. that the danger is present and immediate. 
(People v. Coleman 53 CA 2d 18) 
The following threats of duress are not 
sufficient: 
1. threats of future harm 
2. threats to damage reputation or profession 
3. unreasonable beliefs 
Note: duress is not a defense to a capital crime. In 
cases involving aggravated assault or battery, if the 
duress is not sufficient to constitute a defense, it 
may still reduce the crime to a simple assault or 
battery. 

36 Chapter 4 
4.8 Mitigating Factors and Other Defenses 
Diminished Capacity 
Proposition 8 (passed June, 1982) abolished 
the "diminished capacity" defense in California. 
This defense was used in the past to negate the 
necessary intent in specific intent crimes. For 
example, in many cases, the accused would enter 
evidence to establish that he or she was too intoxi­
cated to form the necessary intent to commit 
murder in the first degree. Presently, evidence of 
diminished capacity may be considered by the 
court only at the time of sentencing or other 
disposition or commitment of the defendant 
(penal Code 25). As discussed below, evidence of 
mental disorder may be used to establish that the 
defendant is not guilty by reason of insanity. 
Entrapment 
The purpose of the entrapment defense is to 
prevent the government from "manufacturing" 
crime (Loewy, Criminal Law 2d ed., page 187). 
Therefore, the defense of entrapment is available 
only in those cases where the crime was notcon­
templated by the defendant, but was actually 
planned and instigated by the police (People v. 
Benford 53 C 2d 1). The entrapment defense does 
not prevent the police from setting a trap for the 
unwary criminal (Sherman v. U.S. 356 US 369). 
The police may provide a person who is pre­
disposed to commit a crime with the opportunity 
to commit the crime. For example, it is not 
entrapment to set up a drug buy ffOm a person who 
is predisposed to sell drugs. Note: the entrapment 
defense is aimed at governmental misconduct. 
Thus, the entrapment defense is not available if 
the entrapment is accomplished by a private per­
son not associated with the government (People v. 
Wirth 186 CA 2d 68). 
The one test for entrapment is the "inno­
cence" test (People v. Benford 53 C 2d 1). Was the 
crime the result of "creative activity" by the 
police or did the police merely offer an oppor­
tunity for a willing criminal to commit a criminal 
offense? The test currently being used in state 
cases is set forth in People v. Barranza (23 C 3rd 
675). The test is: "Was the conduct of the law 
enforcement agent likely to induce a normally law-abiding person to commit a criminal 
offense?" 
Consent of the Victim 
Consent of the victim is not a defense to 
criminal prosecution, except in those cases where 
lack of consent of the victim is an element of the 
crime (Witkin, California Crimes, 163). Listed 
below are some of the common situations involv­
ing the question of consent: 
1. Assault and battery -Consent is not a 
defense to assault and battery. It is a con­
sent to ordinary physical contact involved 
in sporting events. 
2. Rape-In most cases, sexual intercourse 
is not rape if the victim consents. Note: the 
victim must be legally capable of giving 
consent. This aspect is discussed in Chap­
ter 10. 
3. Theft and Robbery -Valid consent to 
taking of the property is a defense to theft 
and robbery crimes. Note: failure to take 
action to prevent the taking of the property 
(passive conduct) is not considered as 
consent. 
4. To constitute consent on the part of the 
victim, the consent must be freely and 
voluntarily given and not under the influ­
ence of fraud, threats, force or duress. 
4.9 Insanity 
Penal Code 25 (b) 
In any criminal proceeding, including any 
juvenile court proceedings, in which a plea of not 
guilty by reason of insanity is entered, this 
defense shall be found by the trier of fact only 
when the accused person proves by a prepon­
derance of the evidence that he or she was incapa­
ble of knowing or understanding the nature and 
quality of his or her act and of distinguishing right 
from wrong at the time of the commission of the 
offense. 
Discussion 
The doctrine of partial insanity is not recogn­
ized in California (People v. Troche 206 C 35). 
Insanity is either a complete defense or no defense 
at all. There is no middle ground in California 

Corpus Delicti and Capacity 37 
criminal law (People v. Perry 195 C 623). Prior to 
1978, California used the M'Naghten Test as the 
test for insanity. [M'Naghten Test is that a person 
is insane if, when the offense was committed, the 
person was laboring under such a mental disease 
or defect that he or she did not know the nature and 
quality of the act, or, if accused did know it, the 
accused did not know that what he or she was 
doing was wrong.] In 1978, the California 
Supreme Court in People v. Drew (22 C 3d 333) 
adopted the American Law Institute Test as the 
standard for California. Proposition 8 (June, 
1982), however, reinstated the M'Naghten Test 
(People v. Horn 158 CA 3d 1014). Note: the 
M'Naghten Test is also referred to as the right 
from wrong test. 
The leading case in California on insanity is 
People v. Skinner (39 C 3d 765). In that case, the 
court held that if the mental illness is manifested 
in delusions which render the individual incapable 
either of knowing the nature and character of his 
act, or of understanding that it is wrong, in moral 
rather than legal sense, he is legally insane. 
In Califomia state trials, the issue of insanity 
must be specially plead. This is accomplished by 
pleading "not guilty by reason of insanity. " Note: 
to raise the issue of not guilty of the crime and the 
issue of insanity, the accused must plead both "not 
guilty" and "not gUilty by reason of insanity." The 
law presumes that an individual is sane, and the 
burden of proof to establish the insanity defense 
by a preponderance of evidence is on the accused 
(People v. Loomis 170 C. 347). The hearing on the 
issue of insanity will be conducted after a finding 
that the accused committed the offense. 
Temporary Insanity 
Temporary insanity existing at the time of the 
act may be sufficient to meet the legal test of 
insanity (People v. Donegan 32 CA2d 716). If the 
defendant is insane at the time that the act was 
committed, it is immaterial that the insanity lasted 
several months or merely a number of hours 
(People v. McCarthy 110 CA 3d 296). 
4.10 Capital Crimes 
In cases in which the death penally may be 
imposed, the trial must be tried in separate phases (p C 190.1). First, the question of the accused's 
guilt shall be determined. At the same time, the 
truth of the alleged special circumstances shall be 
determined. If the defendant is found guilty of 
first degree murder and one or more of the special 
circumstances, further proceedings are held on 
the question of the penalty to be imposed. 
At the additional proceedings, evidence may 
be presented by both the prosecution and the 
defense as to any matter relevant to aggravation, 
mitigation, and sentence including, but not lim­
ited to, the nature and circumstances of the pres­
ent offense, any prior felony conviction or 
convictions, and the defendant's character and 
background (P C 190.3). No evidence, however, 
shall be admissible regarding other criminal 
activity of the accused which does not involve the 
use or attempted use of force or violence or the 
express or implied threat to use force or violence. 
The purpose of the special proceedings is to 
determine whether the penalty shall be death or 
confinement in state prison for life without the 
possibility of parole. After hearing the evidence at 
the special proceedings, the jury must weigh the 
evidence and determine if the mitigating circum­
stances outweigh the aggravating circumstances. 
If so, life imprisonment shall be imposed (P C 
190.3). 
Special Circumstances 
The special circumstances that must be 
alleged and established before the accused is 
subject to capital punishment are set forth in 
Section 190.2 of the Penal Code and include: 
1. Intentional murder, carried out for fman­
cial gain. 
2. Previous conviction of murder in the first 
or second degree. 
3. Conviction of multiple murders in the 
present proceedings. 
4. Murder committed by means of a 
destructive device, bomb, or explosive 
planted, hidden or concealed in any place 
where the defendant knew or should have 
known that the act would create a great 
risk of death to person or persons. 
5. Murder committed to prevent arrest or in 

38 Chapter 4 
an attempted or completed escape from 
lawful custody. 
6. Murder committed by mail bomb. 
7. Victim was a fireman, peace officer, or 
federal law enforcement officer engaged 
in official duties or in retaliation for the 
perfonnance of official duties. 
8. Victim was a witness and killed to pre­
vent his or her testimony in any criminal 
proceedings. 
9. Victim was a prosecutor, assistant pros­
ecutor, fonner prosecutor, or judge and 
the murder was carried out in retaliation 
for or to prevent the perfonnance of 
official duties. 
10. The murder was especially heinous, atro­
cious or cruel. 
11. Murder was intentionally committed by 
lying in wait. 
12. Victim was killed because of his or her 
race, color, religion, nationality or coun­
try of origin. 
13. Murder was committed during or 
attempting one of the below listed 
crimes: 
a. robbery in violation of Section 211 
b. kidnaping in violation of Section 207 
or 209 
c. rape in violation of Section 261 
d. sodomy in violation of Section 286 
e. burglary in the first or second degree 
in violation of Section 460 
f. perfonnance oflewd or lascivious acts 
on a child under the age of 14 in violation 
of Section 288 
g. oral copulation in violation of Section 
288a 
h. arson in violation of Section 447 
i. train wrecking in violation of Section 
219 
14. Victim was intentionally killed by tor­
ture. (This section requires proof of the 
infliction of extreme physical pain no 
matter how long its duration.) 
15. Murder by poison. 
4.11 Malice 
Penal Code 7 (4) 
The words "malice" and "maliciously" import a wish to vex, annoy, or injure another 
person, or an intent to do a wrongful act, estab­
lished either by proof or presumption of law. 
Discussion 
Malice as used in the above statute has a 
different meaning from the general usage defini­
tion. Malice under the Penal Code, Section 7(4) 
can be classified as "malice in fact" and "malice 
in law." Malice in fact (or actual malice), similar 
to the general usage definition, is referred to in the 
first part of the statute by the words "import a 
wish to vex, annoy, or injure another person." 
Malice in law is set forth by the words "an intent 
to do a wrongful act." 
Malice in law may exist in addition to or 
independent of malice in fact. Malice in fact has 
been described as the intentional doing of a 
wrongful act without just reason or excuse for the 
conduct (Davis v. Hearst 160 C 143). 
There is a third type of malice referred to in 
the Penal Code, ,. malice aforethought." The defi­
nition of it is contained in Penal Code 188, imme­
diately after the crime of murder. It has no general 
application, and is limited only to those crimes 
which has • 'malice aforethought" as an element of 
the crime. Malice aforethought is discussed in 
Chapter 9 which covers homicide. 
4.12 Motive 
Motive is the cause or reason that an act is 
committed (People v. Lane 100 C 379). It is the 
moving cause or the ulterior purpose of the 
offender (People v. Durrant 116 C 179). Except for 
crimes involving "heat of passion" or "sudden 
and sufficient provocation," motive is not nor­
mally an element of the crime and need not be 
proved by the prosecution (People v. Woo 181 C 
315). Often evidence of motive is used to establish 
or rebut malice when malice is an element of the 
crime. 
There is a difference between motive and 
intention. Intention to commit a crime may exist 
with or without a motive for doing it. In most 
cases, motive precedes intent. The classical 
example of the difference between motive and 
intent is when A kills B to get B's money. A'sintent 

Corpus Delicti and Capacity 39 
was to commit murder. A's motive was to get the 
money. 
4.13 Intoxication 
Penal Code 22 Voluntary Intoxication 
(a) No act committed by a person while in a 
state of voluntary intoxication is less criminal by 
reason of his having been in such condition. Evi­
dence of voluntary intoxication shall not be admit­
ted to negate the capacity to form any mental 
states for the crimes charged, including, but not 
limited to, purpose, intent, knowledge, pre­
meditation, deliberation or malice aforethought, 
with which the accused committed the act. 
(b) Evidence of voluntary intoxication is 
admissible solely on the issue of whether or not 
the defendant actually formed a required specific 
intent, premeditated, deliberated, or harbored 
malice aforethought, when a specific intent crime 
is charged. 
(c) Voluntary intoxication includes the volun­
tary ingestion, injection, or taking by any other 
means of any intoxicating liquor, drug, or other 
substance. 
Discussion 
In most cases, voluntary intoxication is not a 
defense to or an excuse for criminal conduct. An 
exception to the above general rule is where the 
voluntary intoxication causes insanity. Insanity 
even though caused by voluntary intoxication is a 
defense (People v. Kelly 10 C 3d 565). 
Evidt"l1ce of voluntary intoxication may not be 
admitted to negate the capacity to form the crimi­
nal intent regarding: 
1. knowledge 
2. premedication 
3. deliberation 
4. purpose, 
5. intent, and 
6. malice aforethought. 
Specific Intent Crimes 
With crimes involving specific intent, evi­
dence that the accused was too intoxicated and 
therefore did not form the required specific intent 
is admissible to establish that the crime was not 
committed. For example, an accused may estab­
lish that he or she did not have the necessary criminal intent to commit the crime of burglary 
because of voluntary intoxication. In tlns situa­
tion, the accused is not entering evidence to 
negate the capacity to commit the crime, but to 
establish that the crime was not committed. Note: 
voluntary intoxication is not a defense to, nor legal 
excuse for, general intent crimes. 
4.14 Parties to a Crime 
Penal Code 30 Classification 
The parties to crimes are classified as: 
1. Principals and 
2. Accessories. 
Penal Code 31 Principals 
All persons concerned in the commission of a 
crime, whether it be felony or misdemeanor, and 
whether they directly commit the act constituting 
the offense, or aid and abet in its commission, or 
not being present, have advised and encouraged 
its commission; and all persons counseling, advis­
ing or encouraging children under the age of 
fourteen, lunatics or idiots, to commit any crime, 
or who, by fraud, contrivance or force, occasion 
the drunkenness of another for the purpose of 
causing him to commit any crime, G t who, by 
threats, menaces, command or coercion, compel 
another to commit any crime, are plincipals in any 
crime so committed. 
Penal Code 32 Accessories 
Every person who, after a felony had been 
committed, harbors, conceals or aids a principal 
iII such felony, with the intent that said principal 
may avoid or escape from arrest, trial, conviction 
or pUIDshment, having knowledge that said princi­
pal has committed such felony or has been charged 
with such felony or convicted thereof, is an 
accessory to such felony. 
Discussion 
In California, there are only two parties to a 
crime; principals and accessories. The common 
law classifications of ' 'accessory before the fact" 
and "principal" are merged into "principals" and 
the common law classification of "accessory after 
the fact" is an accessory. To be a principal, one 
must be involved in either the planrung or com­
mission of the offense. Unlike common law, a 
principal does not need to be present at the scene 

------------------------------------------------------------------------. _______ ... ____ i .... 
40 Chapter 4 
of the crime. All principals are equally guilty and 
thus, are subject to the same punishment. 
An accessory is one who after a felony has 
been committed harbors, conceals or aids the 
principal to evade punishment or detection. The 
punishment for an accessory can include 
imprisonment in a state prison or a county jail. 
PIincipal 
To be a principal one must either: 
1. commit the crime, 
2. aid in the commission of the crime, 
3. advise or encourage another to commit the 
crime, 
4. command, threaten, or force another to 
commit a crime, 
5. get another person drunk so that person 
will commit a crime. 
Accessory 
To be guilty as an accessory: 
1. a felony must have been committed; 
2. must have aided, concealed or harbored 
the principal; and 
3. must have intent that the principal avoid or 
escape arrest, prosecution or punishment. 
Assume that A, B, and C rob a bank. C takes 
part in the planning of the robbery and plans to 
receive a portion of the loot. C is not present at the 
scene of the crime. A and B actually go into the 
bank and commit the robbery. After the robbery, 
D hides A, B, and C. D did not know prior to the 
robbery that one was being planned. In this exam­
ple, A, B, and C are all principles. (Note: at 
common law, since C was not present at the scene 
of the crime, he would be an assessory before the 
fact.) D, not taking part in the robbery nor the 
planning for it, is an assessory. 
Accomplice 
An accomplice is one who is liable to prosecu­
tion for the identical offense charged against the 
defendant on trial in the cause in which the 
testimony of the accomplice is given. Penal Code, 
Section 1111, provides that one may not be con­
victed upon the testimony of an accomplice unless 
there is other corroborating evidence which con­
nect the defendant with the commission of the 
offense. 4.15 Attempts 
An attempt to commit a crime is also a crime 
(p C 664). A person may be convicted of an 
attempt to commit a crime, although it appears by 
the evidence that the crime intended or attempted 
was actually completed (p C 663). The elements of 
an attempt are: 
1. A specific intent to commit a particular 
crime. (Note: even if the attempted crime 
is a general intent crime, the accused must 
have the specific intent to commit that 
particular crime, i.e. "specific intent" 
(People v. Rupp 41 C 2d 527). 
2. A direct but unsuccessful act toward com­
pletion of the intended crime. To be an 
attempt, the act or acts committed must go 
further than mere preparation (People v. 
Werner 16 C 2d 216). 
3. An apparent ability to commit the 
intended crime. 
4. The crime must be legally possible to 
commit. 
In some cases, a person may in an unsuccess­
ful attempt to commit one crime, commit another 
crime. In this case, he or she may be punished for 
the attempt to commit the intended crime or the 
other crime (p C 665). For example, a husband 
attempts to kill his wife. He actually kills someone 
else. He can be prosecuted for attempted murder of 
the wife and murder of the other person. 
Beyond Preparation 
As noted earlier, to constitute an attempt there 
must be a direct act or acts committed leading up 
to the intended crime. Mere preparation for com­
mitting the intended crime is not sufficient to 
constitute an attempt. A difficult question to 
answer in many cases is whether or not the act or 
acts committed goes beyond mere preparation and 
thus constitute an attempt. The act or acts are 
sufficient to constitute an attempt if the overt act 
or acts reach far enough toward the accomplish­
ment of the intended offense to amount to the 
commencement of its consummation (People v. 
Lanzit 70 CA 498). 
Th~~ below listed acts were held sufficient to 
constitute an attempt: 

Corpus Delicti and Capacity 41 
1. Intending to kill his wife, the accused 
allowed his accomplice to enter the house 
for the purposes of choking her (People v. 
Parrish 87 CA 2d 853). 
2. The defendant planning to commit a bur­
glary was found outside of a bedroom with 
hands upraised to a bedroom window 
(People v. Gibson 94 CA 2d 468). 
3. Defendant intending to bomb a railroad 
track, noticed officers observing him 
while he was a block away from the track, 
and fled (People v. Davis 24 CA 2d 408). 
4" Defendant was found crouched outside a 
public telephone booth with lock picks and 
his car equipped with coin box burglary 
tools (People v. Charles 218 CA 2d 812). 
The fact of purchasing a gun is only prepara­
tion and not a direct act toward robbery, i.e:. no 
attempt. A similar holding resulted in a Icase 
where the-defendant, several days before the 
planned rol)bery drove by the bank in question to 
look it over. 
Once a direct act leading toward the commis­
sion of the intended offense is completed, the 
crime of attempt is completed, and a later aban­
donment of the plan to commit the intended 
offense is not a d(~fense for the attempt. 
There can be no attempt if it is legally imposs­
ible to commit the intended offense. For example, 
the accused tries to kill a person who is already 
dead. No attempt; it is legally impossible to kill a 
dead person. The fact that other conditions make 
the crime impossible to complete is not normally a 
defense. For example, the accused, intending to 
steal money from a person, reaches into the vic­
tim's pocket and finds it empty. The accused may 
be convicted of an attlempt to steal. 
The test regarding the possibility of comple­
tion of the intended crime is: 
"If there is an apparent ability to commit the 
crime in the way attempted, the attempt is indict­
able, although, unknown to the person making the 
attempt, the crime cannot be committed, because 
the means employed are unsuitable or because of 
extrinsic facts, such as the nonexistence of some 
essential object, or an obstruction by the intended victim, of by a third person." (People v. Siu 126 
CA 2d 41) 
4.16 Conspiracy 
Penal Code 182 Conspiracy Defined 
If two or more persons conspire: 
1. To commit any crime. 
2. Falsely and maliciously to indict another 
for any crime, or to procure another to be 
charged or arrested for any crime. 
3. Falsely to move or maintain any suit, 
action or proceeding. 
4. To cheat and defraud any person of any 
property, by any means which are in them­
selves criminal, or to obtain money or 
property by false pretenses or by false 
promises with fraudulent intent not to per­
form such promises. 
5. To commit any act injurious to the public 
health, to public morals, or to pervert or 
obstruct justice, or the due administration 
of the laws. 
6. To commit any crime against the person of 
the President or Vice President of the 
United States, the governor of any state or 
territory, any United States justice or 
judge, or the secretary of any of the execu­
tive departments of the United States. 
[The last portion of this section on punish­
ment is omitted.] 
Definition 
Conspiracy is an agreement by two or more 
persons to commit any crime, and one of them 
does an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. 
Elements of Conspiracy 
are: The basic elements of the crime of conspiracy 
1. Two or more persons 
2. Agreement to commit a crime 
3. An overt act in furtherance of the 
agreement. 
Discussion 
For conspiracy to be a crime, it is not neces­
sary that the conspired crime be completed or 
even attempted. The overt act required must go 
beyond the agreement or planning stage. The act 

--------------------------------~r'-------- __________________ --------
42 Chapter 4 
must be more than planning, but need not amount 
to an attempt. The act, however, must be in 
furtherance of the conspiracy and must take place 
within California. The overt act may be a lawful 
aetas long as it is in further.anceof the conspiracy 
(People v. Jones 228 CA 2d 74 ,and People v. Smith 
63 C 2d 779). 
Conspiracy is a specific intent crime, since it 
must be established ·that the accused entered into 
the agreement with the intent to do an unlawful act 
or do a lawful act by unlawful means (People v. 
Jones 228 CA 2d 74). All persons involved in the 
conspiracy are equally responsible for the actions 
,of all other parties taken in furtherance ,of the 
~onspiracy. It includes crimes C.ommitted in prep­
aration for, during, commission of, .andduring 
es~ape and arrest. This liability ,does not, 
however, include independent and unrelated 
cri.mes. Crimes committed prior to entry by the 
accused into the conspiracy ,also, ,are not charged 
against him or her. 
Conspiracy requires the .agreement of two or 
more per-sons. At least two of the persons must be 
legally capable of committing a crime. Accord­
ingly, if owy two people are involved and one is an 
idiot, then no conspiracy. The two required per­
sons may be husband and wife. If one of the two IS 
an undercover police officer who enters into the 
agre.ementas part ·of his or her official duties, 
there is no conspiracy. This is based on the con.­
cept that the ,undercover police officer did not in 
fact agree to commit a .crime, ·therefore no agree­
ment. Note: if there are two otherwise qualified 
persons ,who agree to commit a crime in addition 
to the undercover police officer, then.a conspiracy 
may exis.ts. 
Itisnotnecessary that all members agree with 
all other members ·of the conspiracy, only that 
each must know of .the agreement and must make 
. an .agreement with at least one other member of 
the conspiracy. 
Prior to the commission of the conspired 
offense, one may withdraw, and the withdrawal 
will avoid criminal liability if the below require­
mentsare present: 
L A complete withdrawal from all aspects of 
the conspiracy. 2. Must remain away from the scene of the 
crime at time of crime. 
3. Must communicate abandonment to all 
known confederates prior to the commis­
sion of intended offense. 
As a practical maLter to prove an abandon­
ment, the accused should have communicated to 
authorities information regarding the conspiracy. 
(While communication to proper authorities is not 
required, it is almost impossible to prove aban­
donment without the communication.) 
4.17 Solicitation 
In California under Section 653f of the Penal 
Code; it is a crime to solicit another person to 
.commit bribery, murder, robbery, burglary, felony 
theft, arson, receiving stolen property, forcible 
rape, extortion, perjury, forgery, kidnapping, fel­
ony assault, sodomy by force and oral copulation 
by force. Other sections of the code prohibit the 
solicitation for prostitution, lewd acts, etc. (P C 
647(a), (b), and (d). 
The elements of the crime of solicitation are: 
1. act of solicitation 
2. with the specific intent to induce the com­
mission of the offense. 
No overt act or agreement by the person 
solicitated is required. The crime is completed 
with the solicitation. In most cases, conviction 
requires testimony of two witnesses or one wit­
ness and other corroborating evidence. 
Solicitation is a lessor and included offense of 
conspiracy. To constitute the crime of conspiracy 
there must be an agreement and an act committed 
in furtherance of agreement; however, to con­
stitute solicitation, all that is required is the solic­
itation to commit the offense (People v. Bottger 
142 CA 3d 974) .

property of another, or who shall fraudulently 
appropriate property which has been entrusted to 
him, or who shall knowingly and designedly, by 
any false or fraudulent representation or pretense, 
defraud any other person of money, labor or real, 
or personal property, or who causes or procures 
others to report falsely of his wealth or mercantile 
character and by thus imposing upon any person, 
obtains credit and thereby fraudulently gets or 
obtains possession of money, or property or 
obtains the labor or service of another, is guilty of 
, theft. In determining the value of the property 
obtained, for the purposes of this section, the 
reasonable and fair market value shall be the test, 
and in determining the value of the services 
received the contract price shall be the test. If 
there be no contract price, the reasonable and 
going wage for the service rendered shall govern. 
For the purposes of this section, any false or 
fraudulent representation or pretense made shall 
be treated as continuing, so as to cover any money, 
property or service received as a result thereof, 
and the complaint, information or indictment may 
charge that the crime was committed on any date 
during the particular period in question. The 
hiring of any additional employee or employees 
without advising them of every labor claim due 
and unpaid, and every judgment that the employer 
has been unable to meet shall be prima facie 
evidence of intent to defraud.

Discussion 
The present California theft statutes have 
merged the common law crimes of larceny, 
embezzlement and obtaining property by false 
pretenses into the crime of theft (Witkin, Califor­
nia Crimes 341 and People v. Otterman 154 CA 2d 
193). Larceny consisted of the unlawful taking of 
property. Embezzlement consisted of the taking of 
property that had been previously entrusted to the 
individual taking the property (Peoplev.Ailanjian 
114 CA 260). Obtaining property by false pre­
tenses consisted of using false pretenses or trick to 
get possession of the property. 
In merging the offenses into the crime of 
theft, California eliminated the fine distinctions 
and technical niceties which fornlerly existed 
between the common law crimes (Clark and Mar­
shall, Crimes 764 and People v. Carter 131 CA 
177). The consolidation of the common law 
offenses in P C 484 did not create new crimes 
or enlarge the scope of the old crimes (People v. 
Kassab 219 CA 2d 687). 
Common Law Theft Defmed 
Common law theft consists of the taking and 
carrying away the property of another person, 
without the consent of the owner, with the specific 
intent to pennanently deprive th.e owner of the use 
and benefit of the property (People v. Pace 2 CA 
2d 464). 
Elements of Theft 
The elements of theft are: 
1. the taking possession and carrying away of 
property, 
2. property that belongs to another, 
3. without the consent of the owner or the 
person with the right of possession, and 
4. with the specific intent to pennanently 
deprive. 
Discussion 
Distinctions still exist between the various 
types of theft crimes (See 5 Cal. L. Rev. 73). 
Except for cases involving theft by false pretense 
and embezzlement, the Pro2erty must be personal 
property. To be considered as personal property, 
the property must not be real property Oand or 
substances attached to the land) (See: 25 Santa Clara L. Rev. 367). It, also, must have some value 
and be subject to ownership (People v. Quiel 68 
CA 2d 674). 
Real property was not subject to common law 
larceny since there could be no taking and carry­
ing away (People v. Folcey 78 CA 62). If a sub­
stance is severed from real property, it then 
becomes personal property and is subject to the 
theft statutes. For example, gravel on the ground is 
a part of the real estate and is not subject to theft 
by larceny until it is severed from the ground. If an 
individual, however, severs the gravel from the 
ground by loading it into a truck, then the prop­
erty changes its nature from real to personal 
property. Accordingly, the individual is subject to 
the theft statutes when he takes possession of the 
gravel and transports it. A similar situation would 
exist had the individual picked fruit from trees 
belonging to others. Real property can be the 
subject of theft by false pretenses or 
embezzlement. 
Definition of "personal property" under the 
theft statutes is very broad. A list of subscribers to 
a telephone service has been considered by one 
court as personal property and thus subject to the 
theft statute. Utility services are considered as 
personal property and, therefore, subject to the 
theft statutes. It also includes written instruments 
such as checks and stocks. 
Property that is unlawful to possess may still 
be the subject of a theft. For example, a thief could 
be convicted of stealing marijuana from a drug 
dealer. 
Asportation 
To complete the crime of theft, the individual 
must take poss.ession of the property and carry it 
away (People v. Meyer 75 C 383). The tenn 
"asportation" is used to describe the act of taking 
possession and carrying away of property (People 
v Edwards 72 CA 102). A thief who attempts to 
remove an overcoat from a store dummy was not 
convicted of lheft becarJ.!ie >he overcoat was 
chained to the dummy (Peopie v. Meyer 75 C 383). 
The court held that there was no taking possession 
and carrying away of the property. He was, 
however, guilty of attempted theft. 

A person who takes property and hides it in a 
box containing other products has sufficiently 
taken possession and carried away the property 
even if the property is not removed from the 
premises. 
It is not necessary that the taking be from the 
immediate physical presence of the owner or 
possessor. It is assumed that the property is in 
possession of the person who has a right to pos­
sess it. It is grand theft, however, if the property is 
taken from the physical presence of the person. 
Once the individual takes possession, the 
slightest movement is sufficient to establish the 
carrying away requirement. A thief takes a purse 
from an automobile and then immediately drops it 
beside the car when he sees the owner 
approaching the car. He can be convicted of theft. 
The fact that the property was quickly abandoned 
in an attempt to prevent detection is immaterial. 
Once possession and carrying away has 
occurred, the crime is complete. The fact that the 
property is returned to its original position before 
the owner notices that it is missing does not erase 
the fact that a theft has occurred. 
Property that Belongs to Another 
A person cannot be convicted of stealing his 
own property unless someone else has a greater 
right of possession (People v. Cleary 1 CA50). The 
victim of the crime need not be the owner, as long 
as the victim has a right of possession of the 
property. For most purposes, "ownership" and 
"right of possession" are treated as the same 
under this requirement (People v. Brunwin 2 CA 
2d 287). The actual status of ownership of the 
property is immaterial to the thief. Theft is actu­
ally a crime against possession rather than owner­
ship (People v. Beach 62 CA 2d 803). 
"Thief One" steals a car and drives it for two 
weeks. Then, "Thief Two" steals the car from 
"One". In this case, "Two" can be convicted of 
stealing from "One" on the theory that the first 
thiefhas a greater right of possession. (When two 
claims to the right of possession are equal, the 
first in time prevails.) ''Two'' cannot successfully 
defend on the theory that "One" does not own the 
property. The general rule is that the unlawful acts Theft 47 
of the victim in obtaining the property cannot be 
used by the thief to erase the crime. 
Without the Consent of the Owner 
At common law, to be larceny the property 
must be taken without the consent of the owner or 
the person with the right of possession of the 
property. The taking must have been against the 
will of the owner or possessor (People v Re 
Estrada 63 C 2d 740). Under the present theft 
statutes, the taking may be: 
a. against the will, 
b. by trick or fraud, or 
c. by converting property that has been 
entrusted to a person. 
The taking against the will is the common law 
crime oflarceny. The taking by trick or fraud is 
the common law crime of theft by false pretense. 
In the common law crime of embezzlement the 
"taking without the consent of the owner" is the 
converting of property that has been entrusted to a 
person. A classic example of embezzlement is 
where the cashier of a store lawfully takes money 
from customers, but instead of depositing the 
money, he wrongly keeps it for his own use. 
Except for those cases involving embezzle­
ment, theft by trick or device and theft by false 
pretense, to constitute theft the taking and carry­
ing away of the property must be without the 
consent of the owner or possessor. If a person has a 
suspicion that someone is planning to steal his 
property, the person is under no duty to take steps 
to prevent the crime. This non-action is not 
considered as consent to the taking and carrying 
away. The setting of a trap and thereby providing 
an opportunity for a thief to steal property is also 
not considered as consent. 
With the Specific Intent to Pennanently Deprive 
Except as noted below, theft requires that the 
taking be with the specific intent to pennanently 
deprive the owner of the property, money, etc. 
(People v. Kunkin 9 C 3d 245). 
Specific Intent 
Theft is a specific intent crime. The person 
taking the property must know that his taking of 

48 ChapterS 
the property was wrong. Accordingly. if one mis­
takenly takes the property. he or she has not 
committed a theft crime. 
If a person takes another person's property 
believing that he or she has a legal right to take the 
property, he is not guilty of theft. For example, 
mistakenly taking another person's book does not 
constitute theft. 
Pennanently Deprive 
The crime of theft requires the specific intent 
to pennanently deprive the owner or possessor of 
the property. Accordingly, one who takes 
another's property with the intent to use it only 
temporarily is not guilty of theft. Unauthorized 
borrowing may be another crime, but it is not 
stealing. Embezzlement, thefts by false pretenses, 
and vehicle thefts are exceptions to the require­
ment of' 'the intent to pennanently deprive. " With 
embezzlement crimes, thefts by false pretenses. 
and vehicle thefts; as discussed later, the Legisla­
ture has eliminated "the intent to pennanently 
deprive" requirement. 
The intent to pennanently deprive is nonnally 
established by proof of the circumstances that the 
taker acted with the intention to convert the prop­
erty to his or her own use. For example, picking up 
the personal property of another and walking 
away would create a presumption that the taker of 
the property intended to steal it. 
Joe goes into the local grocery store, picks up 
a package of gum and puts it in his pocket. He 
leaves the store without paying for the gum. Joe is 
arrested for theft. He claims that he forgot to pay 
for the gum. If he did in fact forget, then he has not 
committed the crime of theft. To establish his 
guilt, the prosecution would only be required to 
prove that Joe put the gum in his pocket and 
walked out without paying for it. It would be up to 
Joe to establish that the failure to pay was a 
mistake. 
The intent' 'to take the property" must exist at 
the time of the taking. There is no requirement 
that the taking be for gain. All that is needed is the 
specific intent to deprive the owner or possessor 
of his property permanently. Taking of a typewri­
ter without the consent of the owner, but without the intention of depriving him of it permanently is 
not a violation of the theft statutes. It may be a 
violation of another code section. 
Value 
Before an item is subject to the theft statutes. 
it must have some value. The value may only be 
slight. Intrinsic value is considered sufficient to 
support a theft charge (People v. Franco 4 CA 3d 
535). 
Rental or Lease Fraud 
P C 484 (b). (c), (d), and (e) 
(b) Except as provided in Section 10855 of the 
Vehicle Code, intent to commit theft by fraud is 
presumed if one who has leased or rented the 
personal property of another pursuant to a written 
contract fails to return the personal property to its 
owner within 20 days after the owner has made 
written demand by certified or registered mail 
following the expiration of the lease or rental 
agreement for return of the property so leased or 
rented. [Note: Section 10855 of the Vehicle Code, 
listed as an exception to this subdivision, provides 
that failure to return a rented or leased vehicle 
within five days after the agreement expires raises 
the presumption that the vehicle was embezzled.] 
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions ofsubdivi­
sion (b), if one presents with criminal intent iden­
tification which bears a false or fictitious name or 
address for the purpose of obtaining the lease or 
rental of the personal property of another, the 
presumption created herein shall apply upon the 
failure of the lessee to return the rental agreement 
and no written demand for the return of the leased 
or rented property shall be required. 
(d) The presumptions created by subdivisions 
(b) and (0) are presumptions affecting the burden 
of producing evidence. 
(e) Within 30 days after the lease or rental 
agreement has expired, the owner shall make a 
written demand for return of the property so 
leased or rented. Notice addressed and mailed to 
the lessee or renter at the address given at the time 
of the making of the lease or rental agreement and 
to any other known address shall constitute proper 
demand. Where the owner fails to make such 
written demand the presumption created by sub­
division (b) shall not apply. 

Discussion 
Rental or lease fraud presumptions set forth in 
PC 484 (b), (c), (d), and (e) are designed to reduce 
some of the problems encountered when trying to 
establish in court fraudulent intent. The subdivi­
sions provide that when a person leases personal 
property from another by a written contract, the 
failUI'e to return the property within 20 days after 
the owner has made a written demand by certified 
or registered mail following the expiration of the 
lease or rental agreement gives rise to a presump­
tion that the property was taken with the intent to 
commit theft by fraud. Note: to take advantage of 
this presumption, there must be a proper written 
demand for its return. If the owner fails to make 
proper demand, the presumption does not apply 
(p C 484 (e». 
Penal Code 485 Lost Property 
One who finds lost property under circum­
stances which gives him knowledge of or means 
of inquiry as to the true owner, and who appro­
priates such property to his own use, or to the 
use of another person not entitled thereto, 
without first making a reasonable and just effort 
to find the owner is guilty of theft. 
Classification and Punishment 
Theft crimes are classified and punished as 
either petty theft or grand theft. Petty theft is a 
misdemeanor (PC 488) and grand theft is a 
felony (PC 487). 
5.2 Petty Theft 
Penal C.ode 488 Petty Theft 
Theft in other cases [not grand theft] is petty 
theft. 
PenalCode 666 Conviction of Crime After 
Serving Term for theft .... 
Every person who, having been convicted of 
petit theft, grand theft, auto theft under Section 
10851 of the Vehicle Code, burglary, robbery, 
felony receiving stoil'!n propery, or a felony 
violation of section 496 and having served a 
term therefore in a penal institution or having 
been imprisoned thereirt .. , is subsequently 
convicted of petit theft, then the person convict-Theft 49 
ed of such subsequent offense is punishable by 
imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding 
one year, or in the state prison. 
Definition 
Petty theft is defmed in PC 488 as those thefts 
which are not classified as grand theft. Except as 
noted in P C 666, petty thl~ft is punishable by fine 
or by imprisonment in the county jail. 
S.3 Grand Theft 
Grand theft is difficult to defme because of 
the many considerations and conditions under 
which theft is classified as "grand theft." The 
definition of grand theft is set forth in PC 487. 
The punishment for grand theft is imprisonment 
in the county jail or in the state prison (wobbler) 
and/or a fine. Grand theft is theft committed under 
any of the following circumstances: 
1. If the property taken is of a value exceed­
ing $400.00. 
2. If the value of the property taken exceeds 
$100.00 and the property is domestic 
fowls, avocados, citrus fruit, deciduous 
fruit, nuts, articokes, olives, substance 
severed from real estate, other fruits and 
other farm crops, aquacultural products, 
fish, shellfish, kelp, and crustaceans. 
3. If the property or money is taken by an 
employee from an employer and the value 
equals $400.00 or more in any 12 con­
secutive months. 
4. When the property is taken from the body 
of a person or in a container being carried 
by the person. 
S. When the pmperty is (are) a horse, mare, 
gelding, cattle, goats, sheep, mules, 
lambs, pigs, or hogs. 
6. Gold dust, mining claims, quicksilver, 
etc. 
7. Theft of dogs for research, sale or other 
commercial use. 
8. Theft of firearms. 
9. Theft of an automobile (Grand Theft 
Auto). 

50 Chapter 5 
Value Used 
To determine the value of the property for the 
purposes of establishing grand theft, the reason­
able and fair market value at the time that the 
item is stolen is used. It the item is stolen from a 
retail store, then the retail price is used. If services 
are stolen, the reasonable and going wage for 
those services is used. The value used is the 
general market value of the property, not any 
special value it may have to the victim (People v. 
Lizarraga 122 CA 2d 436 and People v. Brown 138 
CA 3d 832). 
The defendant stole jewelry from a store. The 
cost of the jewelry to the store was $54,000 and 
the retail value was $130,000. The appellate court 
held that the trial court was correct in valuing the 
property at its rl;!tail value of $130,000 for the 
purposes of sentence enhancement. (People v. 
Swanson 142 C.A. 3d 104). 
In the case of People v. Ross (25 C.A.3d 190) 
the accused, an automobile dealer, was charged 
with theft for selling automobiles on which 
mileage shown by the odometers had been 
reduced. The court held that the value for the 
purposes of punishment and classification of the 
crime was the amount of money received for the 
cars by the accused, not the damages suffered by 
the victims. 
In another case, the accused received from the 
victims $550 to buy a horse that was represented 
as a full-blooded Arabian mare. The horse was 
only half-Arabian. The defendant contended that 
for purposes of sentence enhancement that only 
the difference in value between a full-blooded 
Arabian and the one received should be consid­
ered. The court held that the total amount of 
money receIved by the accused ($550) should be 
the amount used in determining the type of theft 
involved (Reo pie v. Hess 10 C.A. 3d 1071). 
5.4 Theft of Public Funds and 
Embezzlement 
Penal Code 514 
Every person guilty of embezzlement is 
punishable in the manner prescribed for theft of 
property of the value or kind embezzlement; and 
where the property embezzled is an evidence of debt or right of action, the sum due upon it or 
secured to be paid by it must be taken as its value; 
if the embezzlement or defalcation is of the public 
funds of the United States, or of this state, or of 
any county or municipality within this state, the 
offense is a felony, and is punishable by imprison­
ment in the state prison; and the person so con­
victed is ineligible thereafter to any office of 
honor, trust, or profit in this state. 
5.5 Theft by Larceny 
Larceny is the wrongful taking and carrying 
away of personal property belonging to another 
with the intent to permanently deprive the owner 
ofit. In larceny type thefts, the taking is unlawful. 
In cases involving a wrongful taking, the intent to 
permanently deprive the owner of the property 
may be at the time of the taking of the property or 
at any time while the property is in the possession 
of the thief. Theft by larceny is contained in Penal 
Code 484 (a), set forth earlier in this chapter. 
Elements 
The elements of theft by larceny are: 
1. an unlawful taking 
2. of personal property belonging to another 
3. with the intent to permanently deprive the 
owner of the use or enjoyment of the 
property. 
5.6 Theft by False Pretense 
Penal Code 532 False Pretense -Obtaining 
Property, Labor or Services 
Every person who knowingly and designedly, 
by any false or fraudulent representation or pre­
tense, defrauds any other person of money, labor 
or property, whether real or personal, or who 
causes or procures others to report falsely of his 
wealth or mercantile character, and by thus impos­
ing upon any person obtains credit, and thereby 
fraudulently gets possession of money or property, 
or obtains the labor or service of another, is 
punishable in the same manner and to the same 
extent as for larceny of the money or property so 
obtained. 
Elements 
The elements of the offense of theft by false 
pretenses are: 

1. the defendant made false pretense or 
representation 
2. the pretense or representation was made 
with the intent to defraud owner of 
property 
3. the owner was in fact defrauded in that he 
or she parted with the property in reliance 
on the pretense or representation. 
Discussion 
Theft by false pretense occurs when the vic­
tim is induced to part with the property by false 
pretenses of the thief. The victim relying on false 
representations parts with the title to the property. 
The accused must know that the representations 
are false at the time they are made. The majority 
of the time this crime occurs during the transfer or 
exchange of property. For example, the selling of 
an automobile with the mileage on the odometer 
"rolled back" is theft by false pretense, in that the 
seller is selling an automobile that is represented 
to have lower mileage and thus a higher value. 
The false representations must be representa­
tions of fact not opinion. The statements in selling 
a car, that this is a "good buy" or "this is the best 
buy in town" are statements of opinion not fact. 
The statement that this car has "never been in a 
wreck, " however, is a false statement. 
While a false promise may be the basis for 
theft by false pretense, the prosecution must 
establish that the failure to keep the promise was 
not "merely a commercial default" (People v. 
Kiperman 64 CA 3d Supp. 25). 
The false statement must be of a past, not 
future event. To be theft by false pretenses, the 
victim must rely on the false representation. It is 
not necessary, however, that the false representa­
tion be the sole inducement, but it must be a 
substantial part of the inducement. Note: the 
suspect may be convicted of an attempted theft 
without establishing that the victim relied on the 
false representation. Theft by false pretense 
applies to both real and personal property, 
To be theft by false pretense, the: false pretense 
or representation must have materially influenced 
the owner to part with the property. It, however, 
need not be the sole inducing cause (People v. Theft 51 
Taylor 30 CA 3d 117). The accused to obtain 
property from its owner, made a false statement 
regarding his financial character. The owner of the 
property who wanted to get rid of the property 
knew that the statement was false, but still turned 
the property over to the accused. This is not theft 
by false pretense, since the owner of the property 
was not materially influenced by the false state­
ment in parting with the property. 
The defendant switched price tags on mer­
chandise so as to buy the goods for less than the 
correct price. The store owner was aware that the 
tags had been switched, but allowed the defendant 
to complete the purchase at the incorrect price in 
order to arrest the accused for theft by false 
pretense. When the accused left the store, he was 
arrested in the parking lot. The court held that the 
defendant could not be convicted of theft by false 
pretense since the owner of the merchandise was 
not mislead by the defendant's conduct (People v. 
Lorenzo 64 CA 3d Supp. 25). 
The accused was convicted of theft by false 
pretense when he took money from a farmer by a 
L.~3e promise that the money would be used to 
bribe a county supervisor in order to obtain favor­
able consideration of a lease of county owned 
property (People v. Fujita 43 CA 3d 454). 
5.7 Theft by Trick or Device 
Penal Code 332(a) Card-Monte, Trick and 
Sure-:.thing Games 
Every person who by the game of' 'three-card 
monte", so-called, or any other game, device, 
slight-of-hand, pretensions to fortune-telling, 
trick, or other means whatever, by use of cards or 
other implements or instruments, or while betting 
on sides or hands of any such play or game, 
fraudulently obtains from another person money 
or property of any description, shall be punished 
as in case of larceny of property of like value. 
Defined 
This crime is committed when the possession 
of personal property is obtained by fraud. The 
owner intends to depart with the possession of the 
property but not the title to it. The intent to steal 
must exist at the time that the property is taken 
(People v. Maggart 194 CA 2d 84). 

52 Chapter 5 
Discussion 
This crime is different from theft by false 
pretenses in that in the case of theft by false 
pretenses, the O\vner intends to part with title to 
the property. In theft by trick or device, the owner 
may intend to temporarily part with custody, but 
does not intend to part with the title to the prop­
erty. Larceny by trick or device requires that the 
intent to steal be present at the time of the taking of 
the property (People v. Mason 86 CA 2d 445). 
A thief intending to steal a typewriter, obtains 
custody of it from the victim after convincing the 
victim that he only wants to borrow it. If the thief 
did not intend to return the typewriter at the time 
of the taking, he has committed the crime of theft 
by trick or device. 
Obtaining a loan of money based on a false 
statement that the money will be used for a special 
purpose and wit.lJ. the intent to deprive the owner 
of it is also theft by trick or device. Pigeon drops 
and switches are thefts by trick and device. Note: 
in cases involving theft by trick or device, unlike 
larceny, the intent to permanently deprive must 
exist at the time of the taking or the transfer of 
possession. 
The crime is completed when the thief has 
obtained possession of the property. Theft by trick 
or device is contained in Penal Code 484 (set 
forth above) and Penal Code 332. 
5.8 Theft by Access (Credit) Card 
There are five different types of theft by 
access card crimes set forth in the Penal Code. 
They are: 
1. Acquiring access cards without the card­
holder's or issuer's consent (p C 484e) 
2. Forgery of access card (p C 484t) 
3. Use offorged access card or the misrepre­
sentation as to the identify of the card 
holder (P C 484g) 
4. Fraud by a merchant in accepting forged 
access cards; knowingly honoring 
illegally obtained access card; or receiving 
payment for access card vouchers for 
items not furnished (pC 484g) 
5. Counterfeiting or illegally completing 
incomplete access cards (P C 484i) An accused who uses another person's credit 
and signing the other person's name to the access 
card may be guilty of both theft and forgery 
(people v. Cobb 15 CA 3d 1). 
5.9 Defrauding Proprietors of Hotels, Inns, 
etc. 
Any person who obtains any food, fuel, ser­
vices, lodging, or accommodations at a hotel, inn, 
restaurant, boardinghouse, apartment house, 
motel, etc. without paying for it and with the 
intent to defraud is guilty of this crime (p C 547). 
In addition, leaving any of the above places after 
obtaining credit without the intent to pay for 
services, etc. provided is a crime under this stat­
ute. The use of false pretenses to obtain services, 
etc. is also a crime under this provision. 
Leaving a restaurant without paying for the 
meals or filling up the car with gas and driving off 
without paying creates a presumptive violation of 
this statute. 
5.10 Theft of Utility Services 
Any person who obtains utility services with 
the intent to avoid payment for the services is 
guilty of the theft of utility services. Utility ser­
vices are defmed as any electric.al, gas or water or 
any other service provided by a public utility for 
compensation. This crime includes the act of 
reconnecting utility service that has been lawfully 
disconnected by the utility and the use of devices 
to prevent the meter from accurately measuring 
the services provided (P C 498). 
5.11 Theft by Embezzlement 
Penal Code 503 Embezzlement Defined 
Embezzlement is the fraudulent appropriation 
of property by a person to whom it has been 
entrusted. 
Elements of Embezzlement 
The elements of embezzlement are: 
1. the property embezzled belonged to 
another; 
2. the property was legally entrusted to the 
accused as agent, employee, bailee, 
trustee, or servant (a fiduciary relation­
ship exists); 

3. the necessary taking and carrying away 
occurred; and 
4. at the time of the taking and carrying 
away, the accused had the intent to perma­
nently or temporarily deprive the owner of 
the property. 
Discussion 
Theft by embezzlement is theft of property 
that has been entrusted to the taker. In embezzle­
ment cases, the thief steals property that has 
legally been entrusted to him or her. It is a viola­
tion of the relationship of trust and confidence 
(fiduciary relationship) (People v. Fox 43 CA 399 
and People v. Whitney 121 CA 2d 515). 
A bank teller receives money from a bank's 
customers for deposit. If the bank teller steals the 
money rather than depositing it, the teller has 
committed the crime of theft by embezzlement. 
An attorney receives money on behalf of his 
client. Rather than forwarding the money to the 
client, the attorney deposits it to his own account 
and fails to tell his client of the payment. The 
attorney has committed the crime of 
embezzlement. 
The two key distinctions between embezzle­
ment and theft by larceny are: 
1. in embezzlement, the original taking of 
the property is legal (people v. Burchers 
199 C 52); and 
2. in embezzlement, the intent may be to 
only temporarily deprive the owner of the 
property (People v. Braiker 61 CA 2d 406). 
There is no requirement that the property 
belong wholly to another. A partner may be con­
victed of embezzling property belonging to a 
partnership. It is necessary that at the time of the 
embezzlement that the accused have actual con­
trol of the property (entrusted to the accused). If 
the property has not been "entrusted" to the 
accused, he or she is not guilty of embezzlement 
but may be guilty of another type of theft. 
Property subject to embezzlement may be 
money, goods, chattels, things in evidence of debt, 
right of action and real property. If the amount 
taken by a servant, agent or employee from his or Theft 53 
her employer or principal totals $400.00 or more 
in any 12 month period, the crime is a grand theft. 
This crime is a modem day statutory crime. 
At common law, there was no crime of theft by 
embezzlement. 
There is a special embezzlement statute per­
taining to public employees. Penal Code 504 is set 
fOrtII above. This statute applies to any state, 
county or city employee who fraudulently appro­
priates for his own use or for any purpose not 
authOlized any public property in his possession 
or under his control. 
5.12 Theft of Lost or Mislaid Property 
Civil Code, Section 2080 provides that any 
person who finds lost property is not bound to take 
charge ofit, but ifhe or she does, he or she has the 
obligation to take care of the property and inform 
the owner, if known, within a reasonable time of 
the location of the property. The finder may 
legally charge the Owner only a reasonable charge 
for saving and taking care of the property. 
A person who steals lost or mislaid property is 
guilty of theft under the following conditions: 
1. the property is lost or mislaid under cir­
cumstance that by inquiry the true owner 
can be identified and located, 
2. no reasonable inquiry is made to fmd the 
owner and restore the property to him, and 
3. the fmder appropriates the property for his 
own use or the use of another (p C 485). 
The above conditions only apply to property 
that has been lost or mislaid. It does not apply to 
property that has been abandoned. The crime is 
completed when having possession of the prop­
erty, the finder fOIms the intent to appropriate the 
property for his own use (/ n re Greg F. 159 CA 3d 
466). 
5.13 Vehicle Theft (P C 499b and V C 10851) 
There are two vehicle theft statutes in Califor­
nia. In both statutes, only temporarily taking is 
required to constitute the theft. The two crimes 
are: 
Under Penal Code 499b-Vehic1e theft is the 
wrongful taking of any automobile, motorcycle, 

54 Chapter 5 
motorboat, vessel or vehicle for the purposes of 
temporarily using or operating. This offense is 
also known as the "joy-ride" crime. It is designed 
to prevent the unauthorized "joy-riding" in other 
people's autos. This crime is a misdemeanor. 
Under Vehicle Code 10851-Any person who 
drives or takes a vehicle not his own, without the 
consent of the owner and with the intent to either 
permanently or temporarily deprive the owner of 
his or her title or possession of the vepjcle is guilty 
of vehicle theft. Auto theft under the provisions of 
the Vehicle Code 10851 is a felony (Grand Theft 
Auto). Note: this crime, unlike the other offense, 
requires the intent to either permanently or tem­
porarily deprive the owner of title or possession of 
the vehicle. 
5.14 Diversion of Cpnstruction Funds 
Penal Code 484b provides that any person 
who receives money for construction purposes 
and willfully fails to apply the funds for the 
intended purposes is guilty of a felony if the 
amount misapplied is in excess of $1,000. If the 
amount misapplied is $1,000 or less, the crime is a 
misdemeanor. 
Penal Code 484c provides that any person 
who submits a false voucher to obtain con­
struction funds and does not use the funds for the 
intended purposes is guilty of embezzlement 
5.15 Trade Secrets 
Penal Code 499c (b) 
Every person is guilty of theft who, with 
intent to deprive or withhold from the owner 
thereof control of a trade secret, or with an intent 
to appropriate a trade secret to his or her own use 
or to the use of another, does any of the following: 
1. steals, takes, carries away, or uses without 
authorization a trade secret; 
2. fraudulently appropriates any article 
representing a trade secret entrusted to 
him; 
3. having unlawfully obtained access to the 
article, without authority makes or causes 
to be made a copy of any article represent­
ing a trade secret; or 4. having obtained access to the article 
through a relationship of trust and confi­
dence, without authority and in breach of 
the obligations created by such relation­
ship makes or causes to be made, directly 
from and in the presence of the article, a 
copy of any article representing a trade 
secret. 
5.16 Receiving Stolen Property (P C 496) 
Elements of Receiving Stolen Property 
The required elements of receiving stolen 
property are: 
1. a person who knowingly 
2. buys, receives, conceals or withholds 
3. property that has been obtained by theft or 
extortion. 
Discussion 
P C 496 provides that any person who know­
ingly buys or receives any property which has 
been stolen is guilty of this crime. If a person buya 
or receives stolen property under such circum­
stances that he should suspect that the property is 
stolen, there is an inference that he was aware that 
it was stolen. 
To be convicted of this offense, the property 
must be stolen property. If the police use its own 
property or property borrowed from someone as a 
setup, the accused may be guilty of only an 
attempt to receive stolen property. This is based on 
the concept that the property that the accused is 
receiving is not in fact stolen property. 
Receiving stolen property is distinct from the 
crime of stealing the property. A person cannot be 
convicted of both stealing and of receiving the 
same stolen property. In People v. Stewart 185 CA 
3d 197, the defendant's conviction of receiving 
stolen property was overturned. The defendant 
had been convicted of both burglary and receiving 
stolen property. The court held that a person could 
not be convicted of both stealing the property and 
receiving stolen property where the evidence 
shows that the property received was the same as 
the property taken in the theft and that a burglar 
could not be convicted of receiving stolen prop­
erty from himself. Note: if the burglar or thief 
disposes of the property and then receives itback, 

he/she may be guilty of both theft or burglary and 
receiving stolen property. 
Mere possession of stolen property alone is 
insufficient to establish the offense of receiving 
stolen property. A person in the business of buy" 
ing, dealing with or collecting used property, 
however, has a duty to conduct an inquiry into the 
legal right of a seller to sell or deliver the property 
being offered. Failure to do so under such circum­
stances that would indicate that the property may 
be stolen, creates an inference that the person 
receiving the property knew that it was stolen 
property. 
Possession accompanied by suspicious cir­
cumstances may be sufficient to establish the 
inference that the property was received with 
knowledge that it was stolen. Factors used to 
indicate knowledge that the property was stolen 
include: 
1. false statements regarding how the prop­
erty came into the accused's possession, 
2. hiding the property, 
3. failure to identify the person from whom 
the accused received the property, 
4. flight from location of the property when 
the police arrived, 
5. attempting to destroy the property, 
6. possession of the property with identify­
ing marks removed, and 
7. extremely low price on high value items. 
In one case, the court held that while the 
unexplained possession of stolen property, stand­
ing alone, is not sufficient to support a conviction 
for receiving stolen property, it is the circum­
stances which could lead reasonable persons to 
believe that the possessor either stole it or received 
it with the knowledge that it was stolen (People v. 
Edwards 14 CA 3d 57). Possession of recently 
stolen property raises such a strong inference that 
only slight additional evidence is needed to sup­
port a conviction (People v. Britz 17 CA 3d 743). 
Possession under this statute is defined as the 
exercise of dominion and control over the prop­
erty. It is not necessary that the property be under 
the immediate control of the accused, as long as 
he has control of it and knows of its location. The Theft 55 
property can be in the possession of more than one 
person. 
A person who receives stolen property is not 
guilty of being an accomplice to the crime of 
theft, unless the person makes an arrangement 
with the thief before the theft is committed. If an 
arrangement is made between the thief and the 
receiver prior to the theft, then the thief is an 
accomplice of the receiving of stolen property and 
also the receiver is an accomplice to the theft. 
5.17 Goods Stolen in Another State 
Penal Code 497 
Every person who, in another state or country 
steals or embezzles the property of another, or 
receives such property knO\ving it to have been 
stolen or embezzled, and brings the same into this 
state, may be convicted and punished in the same 
manner as if such larceny, or embezzlement, or 
receiving, had been committed in this state. 
5.18 Single or Multiple Thefts 
It is sometimes necessary to determine if 
there is one single theft or separate smaller thefts. 
The general rule is if there is one general intent to 
steal and one general plan, it is all one theft 
(People v Fleming 220 C 601). In this case, the 
values may be added for the purposes of detcnnin­
ing if a grand theft has occurred. If the takings do 
not meet those requirements then each one is 
considered as a separate crime and may be 
punished separately. 
The taking of several articles at one time 
normally is considered as one crime. The defen­
dant stole several items of property belonging to 
different owners. In determining if the accused 
committed grand theft or several petty thefts, the 
court instructed the jury that the value of the 
articles should be aggregated if the defendant had 
one general overall plan and should be considered 
separate offenses if the accused had no overall 
plan to steal them (People v. Sullivan 80 CA 3d 16). 
A series of thefts from one person as a part of one 
general plan is also considered as one crime. 
A mother who obtained monthly welfare 
checks for a period of six months based on one 
false representation was guilty of only one theft. 
An angry employee who sold his employer's goods 

56 ChapterS 
dUling a two-week period and kept the proceeds, 
was considered as guilty of only one crime since 
he had only one general intent and general plan. 
!).19 Alteration of Serial Numbers (P. C. 
!i37e) 
Penal Code 537e Possession of Articles From 
Which Name Plates Removed-Misdemeanor 
(a) Any person who knowingly buys, sells, 
n~ceives, disposes of, conceals, or has in his 
possession a radio, piano, phonograph, sewing 
machine, washing machine, typewriter, adding 
machine, comptometer, bicycle, a safe or vacuum 
cleaner, dictaphone, w"tch, watch movement, 
wutch case, or any mechanical or electrical device, 
appliance, ... from which the manufacturer's 
narneplate, serial number or any other distinguish­
ing number or identification mark has been 
removed, defaced, covered, altered or destroyed, 
is guilty of a misdemeanor. If the value of any 
integrated chip from which the nameplate, serial 
number, or other distinguishing mark is removed, 
defaced, covered, altered, or destroyed exceeds 
four hundred ($400), the offense is a felony 
punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not 
to exceed one year or in the state prison.

Burglary 
We inflict atrocious injuries on the burglars we catch in order to 
make the rest take effectual precautions against detection. (Ge>')rge

6.1 Burglary 
Penal Code 459 Acts Constituting Burglary; 
"Inhabited Defined." 
Every person who enters any house, room, 
apartment, tenement, shop, warehouse, store, 
mill, bam, stable, outhouse or other building, 
tent, vessel, as defined in Section 21 of the Har­
bors and Navigation Code., railroad car, locked or 
sealed cargo container, whether arnot mounted on 
a vehicle, trailer coach, as defined in Section 635 
of the Vehicle Code, any house car, as defined in 
Section 362 of the Vehicle Code, inhabited 
camper, as defined by Section 243 of the Vehicle 
Code, vehicle as defined by Vehicle Code when 
the doors are locked, aircraft as defined by Sec­
tion 21012 of the Public Utilities Code, mine or 
any underground portion thereof, with the intent 
to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is 
guilty of burglary. As used in this chapter, "inhab­
ited" means currently being used for dwelling 
purposes whether occupied or not. A house, 
59 trailer, or portion of a building is currently being 
used for dwelling purposes if, at the time of the 
burglary, it was not occupied solely because a 
natural or other disaster caused the occupants to 
leave the premises. 
Burglary Defined 
The entering of a building or place listed in P. 
C. 459,with the intent to commit grand or petit 
larceny (theft) or any felony constitutes burglary. 
The essence of the crime of burglary is tlle 
unlawful entry and the dangers associated with 
such an entry (People v. Lamica 249 CA 2d 640). 
The crime is completed with the entry (People v. 
Clifton 148 CA 2d 276). Burglary statutes are 
based on the premise that the intruder may harm 
the occupants in process of attempting to commit 
the crime (people v. Lewis 274 CA 2d 912). 
An additional purpose of the burglary statutes 
is the protection of buildings and property, 
especially residences. At common law, burglary 
required the breaking and entering of a dwelling 
house during the time of darkness. California 
burglary statutes have eliminated the require­
ments of "breaking" and "entry during the hours 
of darkness" (People v. Scofield 149 CA 3d 536). 
The statutes have also included structures other 
than dwellings and vehicles to the places subject 
to burglary. 

60 Chapter 6 
To constitute burglary, the entering of the 
building or vehicle must be with the intent to 
commit grand or petty theft or any felony (People 
v Lamica 274 CA 2d 640). Burglary is a specific 
intent crime (People v. GreeH 228 CA 2d 437). The 
intended offense is separate from the burglary 
crime (People v. Garnett 29 C 622). Accordingly, 
one entering a building for the purpose of commit­
ting a theft therein is guilty of both the crime of 
burglary and, at least, an attempted theft. In many 
cases, the crime of burglary is a more serious 
offense than the crime contemplated after entry. 
For example, petty theft is a misdemeanor, but 
entering an inhabited dwelling with the intent to 
commit a petty theft is first degree burglary (Peo­
ple v. Wolfe 257 CA 2d 420). 
Elements of Burglary 
The elements of statutory burglary in Califor-
nia are: 
1. An entry 
2. Into a building, structure or vehicle 
3. With the intent to commit grand or petty 
larceny (theft) or a felony 
Discussion 
The Entry Requirement 
There is no requirement that the entry be a 
forcible entry (People v. Talbot 64 C2d 691). The 
entry may either be "actual" or "constructive. " A 
constructive entry occurs when an agent, con­
federate, accessory, or aider and abettor enters the 
structure, instead of the defendant (People v. 
Bonilla 124 CA 212). For example, in one case, the 
accused was convicted of burglary based on the 
entry into a railroad car by his confederate. In <ilis 
case, the confederate passed the stolen hams out­
side the railroad car to the defendant (People v. 
Failla 64 C 2d 560). 
Ifmore than one entry is made in the building, 
the crime is completed when the first entry is 
made (People v. Jones 225 CA 2d 434). There is 
also no requirement that the entry be illegal (Peo­
ple v. Edwards 22 CA 3d 598 and People v. Barry 
94 C 481). 
A person may be convicted of burglary even 
though he or she had permission to enter the building from the owner. For example, the enter­
ing of a store that is open for business is a 
sufficient entry provided that at the time of the 
entry the accused had the intent to commit a crime 
(People v. Brittian 142 C 8). This is based on the 
concept that any permission to enter is canceled by 
the criminal intent of the accused. 
The accused was invited into a house by the 
resident and asked to wait for a few moments. The 
accused instead stole some jewelry and left. The 
court instructed the jury that the accused could be 
convicted of burglary if the jury determined that 
he had the intent to steal at the time he entered the 
house (People v. Lowen 42 P 32). 
While an entry, either actual or constructive, 
is an essential element of the crime, an accused 
may not be convicted of burglary if the accused 
has an absolute rightto enter the building. Thus, if 
the accused who leases a building for a legal 
purpose and later during the period of the lease 
enters it for the purposes of stealing the fixtures 
therein, there has been no entry for pUlposes of 
the burglary statutes. This is based on the theory 
that the accused had an unconditional right to 
enter the building and therefore did not violate any 
possessory right (People v. Gauze 15 C 3d 709). 
Entering the building is an essential require­
ment. The body of the accused, however, does not 
have to physically enter the structure (People v. 
Allison 200 C 407). Constructive entering is suffi­
cient. For example, using a drill bit to bore a hole 
into the building has been held to be "an entry" 
where a portion of the bit entered into the build­
ing. In another case, entry was considered com­
plete when the accused used a crowbar to open a 
window and then reached into the building with a 
hook and removed an item of personal property 
(People v. Pettinger 94 CA 297). Sending a trained 
animal into the building to fetch an item of prop­
erty would, also, be an entry. Reaching an arm 
through a broken window into a building in order 
to steal a ham hanging in the building constitutes a 
sufficient entry. The entry of an agent, accessory, 
etc. is imputed to the accused (people v. Walters 
249 CA 2d 547) . 
The required entry may be to an interior room 
of a building. An accused, for example, enters a 

Burglary 61 
building without the necessary intent. After enter­
ing the building and finding it empty, he fonns the 
intent to steal and enters another room for pur­
poses of fmding something to steal. The entering 
of the interior room with the intent to steal is 
sufficient to constitute the crime of burglary. The 
accused entered one building to facilitate the com­
mission of theft in an adjoining area, the entry was 
sufficient to constitute burglary (People v. Garcia 
214 CA 2d 681 Note: reversed on other grounds). 
In one recent case, the accused stole an auto­
matic teller machine (ATM) card and attempted to 
use it to withdraw money from an A1M built into 
the wall of a bank. He was convicted of burglary. 
The question on appeal was whether or not the act 
of inserting a bank card into the A1M was suffi­
cient entry of the building to constitute the crime 
of burglary. The California Court of Appeals, 
Second Circuit, in affinning the conviction, held 
that where the ATMs are fimlly affixed to and 
attached to the inside of a bank building and 
covered by the bank roofs, they are buildings 
within the meaning of the burglary statutes. The 
act of inserting a card into them with the intent to 
commit a felony is sufficient entry of the building 
to constitute burglary (People v. Ravenscroft 198 
CA 3rd 639). 
In People v. Nible (L.A. Daily Journal, Daily 
Appellate Reports, April 26, 1988, p. 5135), the 
accused on appeal contented that he was not guilty 
of burglary where the evidence established that he 
had penetrated the window screen but not the 
window. The court held that the penetration of the 
screen was a sufficient "entry" to uphold a bur­
glary conviction. The California Court of 
Appeals, Third Appellate District, stated that: 
Burglary laws are based primarily 
upon a recognition of the dangers to 
personal safety created by the usual 
burglary situation . " . The laws are 
designed not to deter trespass ... so 
much as to forestall the gemlination of 
a situation dangerous to personal 
safety. 
As noted earlier, at common law, the entry 
was required to be during the hours of darkness. Since a 1982 amendment to the Penal Code, time 
of entry is immaterial. 
The Building 
A building, structure or vehicle includes: 
a. structure with enclosed walls and a roof, 
b. an open pit mine, 
c. enclosed telephone booth, 
d. railroad cars, 
e. aircraft, 
f. cargo container of at least 1,000 cubic feet, 
penn anent character, strong enough for repeated 
use, designed to facilitate the carriage of goods 
and designed to be easy to fill and empty (p.e. 
458), 
g. locked vehicle, 
h. locked trunk of a locked or unlocked vehicle, 
and 
i. locked or unlocked inhabited camper. 
Note: to be a building, the structure must 
have four walls and a roof. A bin with a roof and 
three walls was not a building for purposes of this 
crime (People v. Gibbons 206 C 112). A telephone 
booth with three walls, roof and a folding door on 
the fourth side is a building for purposes of this 
statute (People v. Miller 95 CA 2d 631). 
Required Intent 
The intent to commit grand theft, petty theft, 
or any felony must be a specific intent (People v. 
Falla 64 C 2d 560 and People v. Earl 29 CA 3d 
894). The accused must have the specific intent at 
the time of the entry. It does not need be a 
completed intention. The fact that the intention is 
frustrated by outside factors or that there is a 
voluntary cessation of effort after entry does not 
eliminate an otherwise sufficient intent (People v. 
Markus 82 CA 3d 477). 
It is not necessary that the accused intended to 
commit the crime in the building (People v. Wright 
206 CA 2d 184). It is sufficient that the intended 
entry was to facilitate the commission of the 
crime. For example, the accused has committed 
the crime of burglary when he enters the house to 
hide while waiting for an opportunity to steal from 
people passing by. 
If the entry is made without the specific 
intent, the crime of burglary has not been com­
mitted (People v. Collins 53 C 185). An accused 

62 Chapter 6 
who was too intoxicated to form an intent to steal 
or to commit a felony does not commit the crime 
ofburgla1.Y when he enters the building (People v. 
Yoder 100 CA 3d 333). 
If the accused makes only one entry into a 
building with the intent to commit tw~ or more 
felonies, he or she is guilty of only one burglary 
since the entry is the primary focus of the offense 
(People v. Failla 64 C 2d 560). Accordingly, an 
accused may be convicted of only one burglary 
when he enters the home with the intent to both 
assault and rob the woman resident (People v. 
Clifton 148 CA 2d 276). 
The required intent may be established in 
court by circumstantial evidence and by reason­
able inferences (People v. Martin 275 CA 2d 769). 
For example, if it is proven that an accused entered 
a home and attempted to rape a woman therein, 
the court or jury may reasonably infer that the 
accused intended to commit rape at the time he 
entered. 
Completed Crime 
The crime of burglary is completed when the 
accused enters the building. It does not matter that 
the accused was unable to complete the offense 
intended when he entered the building. For exam­
ple, an accused intending to steal a briefcase 
breaks open the door of a locked vehicle. If he is 
stopped after opening the door, but before stealing 
the briefcase, he has committed the crimes of 
burglary and attempted theft. In one case, the 
court held that the crime of burglary was com­
pleted when the defendant entered his ex-wife's 
apartment with the intent to commit an assault and 
a theft therein. It was immaterial that he did not 
assault the ex -wife or commit theft after the entry 
(People v. Clifton 148 CA 2d 276). 
Locked Vehicle 
As noted earlier, automobiles are subject to 
burglary if they are locked. A trailer was consid­
ered as a locked vehicle where the doors were 
sealed by a locked metal clip (People v. Massie 241 
CA 2d 812). 
In People v. Woods (112 CA 3d 226), the court 
held that a vehicle was not a "locked" vehicle 
where the doors were locked, but one window was deliberately rolled down approximately five 
inches. In People v. Malcolm (47 CA 3d 217), 
however, the court held that a vehicle was 
"locked" where all the doors were locked and the 
windows rolled up. The wing lock on the left front 
window, however, was broken. The broken wing 
lock enabled the accused to push open the wing, 
and thus open the door. In People v. Burns (114 CA 
2d 566), a burglary conviction was reversed where 
no proof was entered that the motor vehicle was 
locked at the time of the entry. 
6.2 Degrees of Burglary 
Burglary is classified as either first or second 
degree (p.C. 460). First degree burglary is every 
burglary of an inhabited dwelling house or trailer 
coach as defined by the Vehicle Code, or the 
inhabited portion of any other building. All other 
kinds of burglary are of the second degree. An 
important exception to the classification of bur­
glary is burglary by use of acetylene torch or 
explosive (p.C. 464), This latter crime has its own 
punishment schedule. 
Note: "inhabited camper," "railroad car," 
and "vehicle when its doors are locked" are 
omitted from the list of places subject to first 
degree burglary. One appellate court held that 
such an omission raised an inference that the 
legislature did not intend to inClude such places in 
the classification of first degree burglary even if 
they were inhabited. (People v. Moreland 146 Cal. 
Rptr 118) 
Inhabited 
For the purposes of the burglary statutes, 
"inhabited" means that the structure is currently 
being used for dwelling purposes. Dwelling pur­
poses refers to a place where a person with pos­
sessory rights uses the place as sleeping quarters 
and intends to do so in the future. There can be 
more than one dwelling under a common roof as in 
an apartment house or hotel. A furniture store 
where a night watchman regularly slept was an 
inhabited dwelling (People v. Marquez 143 CA 3d 
797). 
There is no requirement that the structure be 
occupied at the time of the entry or attempted 
entry. A residence is an inhabited dwelling, even if 

Burglary 63 
the residents are away on a vacation. A house that 
is vacant because the residents have moved is not 
inhabited (People v. Stewart 113 CA 2d 687). 
In those cases where the residents are absent, 
the house is considered as inhabited as long as the 
residents intend to return. For example, a house 
was considered as "inhabited" where the sole 
resident was confined to a hospital for an indefi­
nite time. In this case, the resident still intended to 
return to the house and presently considered it her 
home (People v. Marquez 143 CA 3d 797). 
The entry into an attached garage of an inhab­
ited house was considered in one case as burglary 
of an inhabited dwelling. The court stated that 
where the garage is an integral part of the struc­
ture, it is simply one room of several. Burglary of 
a storeroom connected to the home by a breeze­
way was also considered as burglary of an inhab­
ited dwelling (People v. Cook 135 Ca 3d 785). 
There is no requirement for the accused to 
know that the building was "in11abited". In one 
case, the accused entered a building to steal items 
therein. He was under the impression that the 
house was no longer occupied as a residence. He 
was convicted of first degree burglary. The appel­
late court stated that the knowledge of the accused 
as to whether or not the house was inhabited is not 
an el~ment of first degree burglary (People v. 
Guthrie 144 CA 3d 832). 
In a similar case, the defendant broke into the 
first floor of a three-story warehouse. The accused 
was unaware that the third floor was being used as 
a residence by a couple who worked in the build­
ing. He appealed his conviction of first degree 
burglary on the basis that his mistake as to the 
nature of the building (as an inhabited building) 
was reasonable. The court upheld the conviction 
and stated that the belief of the accused as to 
whether or not the building was inhabited had no 
bearing on the case (People v. Parker 175 CA 3d 
818). 
A 1987 change to Penal Code 459 provides 
that a house, trailer, or portion of the building that 
is currently being used for dwelling purposes is 
still inhabited if the occupants are not occupying it 
solely because of a natural or other disaster which 
caused the occupants to leave the premises. 6.3 Punishment 
1. First degree burglary is punished by 
imprisonment in the state prison. 
2. Second degree burglary is punished by 
imprisonment in the county jail not 
exceeding one year or in the state prison. 
3. Burglary by use of acetylene torch or 
explosive is punished by imprisonment in 
the state prison. 
Penal Code 1170.95 provides that the total of 
the terms for consecutive residential burglaries 
that are not' 'violent felonies" shall not exceed ten 
years. Residential burglary is defmed as burglary 
of an inhabited house, trailer coach or the inhab­
ited portion of any other building. 
Probation Limitations 
P.C. 462 provides that, except in unusual 
cases where the interests of justice would best be 
served ~~' the person is granted probation, proba­
tion shall not be granted to any person convicted of 
a burglary of an inhabited dwelling house or 
trailer or the inhabited portion of any other 
building. 
If the court grants probation as an unusual 
case, the court must specify the reason or reasons 
for granting probation. 
6.4 Burglary By Use of Acetylene Torch or 
Explosive 
Penal Code 464 
Any person who, with intent to commit crime, 
enters either by day or night, any building, 
whether inhabited or not, and opens or attempts to 
open any vault, safe, or other secure place by use 
of acetylene torch or electric arc, burning bar, 
thermal lance, oxygen lance, or any other similar 
device capable ofbmning through steel, concrete, 
or any other solid substance, or by use of nitro­
glycerine, dynamite, gunpowder, or any other 
explosive, is guilty of a felony and, upon convic­
tion, shall be punished by imprisonment in the 
state prison. .. . 
Elements of Burglary 
The elements of BUlrglary by Use of Torch or 
Explosives: 
1. entry to any building, 

64 Chapter 6 
2. with the specific intent to commit a crime, 
3. by use of torch, explosive, etc., and 
4. opening or an attempt to open a. safe, vault 
or other secure place. 
Discussion 
Burglary by use of a torch or by explosives is 
an aggravated form of burglary, since the using of 
a torch or explosives increases the danger that 
someone will be injured or killed. An additional 
purpose of the increased penalty is to discourage 
an accused from using a torch or explosives when 
confronted with a secure depository (People v. 
Chastain 262 CA 2d 433). 
A "secure place" is a storage place that has 
most of the attributes of a safe or vault and is 
designed for the purposes of keeping valuables. 
"Safe" and "vault" are used in their ordinary and 
popular meaning (People v. Cook 135 CA 3d 785). 
6.5 Unlawful Entry 
Penal Code 602.5 Unauthorized Entry of 
Dwelling 
Every person other than a public officer or 
employee acting within the course and scope of 
his employment in performance of a duty imposed 
by law, who enters or remains in any noncommer­
cial dwelling house, apartment, or other such 
place without the consent of the owner, his agent, 
or the person in lawful possession thereof, is 
guilty of a misdemeanor. 
Discussion 
The unauthorized entering or remaining in a 
noncommercial dwelling is not a necessarily 
included lessor offense of the crime of burglary. 
An accused was convicted of unlawful entry under 
P.e. 602.5 when evidence established that the 
accused had entered a dwelling to steal, but was 
too drunk to form the specific intent necessary for 
a burglary conviction (People v. M uis 163 Cal Rptr 
791). Unlawful entry under this statute does not 
apply to nonresidential structures (In Re D.C,L. 
147 Cal Rptr 54), 
6.6 Possession of Burglary Tools 
Penal Code 466 Burglar Too!s 
Every person having upon him or her or in his 
or her possession a picklock, crow, keybit, crowbar, screwdriver, vice grip pliers, water­
pump pliers, sEdehammer, slim jim, tension bar, 
lock pick, floor-safe gun, tubular lock pick, floor­
safe door puller, master key or other instrument or 
tool with the intent feloniously to break or enter 
into any building, railroad car, aircraft, or vessel, 
trailer coach, or vehicle defined in the Vehicle 
Code, without being requested to do by some 
person having the .right to open the same, or who, 
shall make, alter, or repair any instrument or 
thing, knowing or having reason to believe that it 
is intended to be used in committing a misde­
meanor or felony, is guilty of a misdemeanor. Any 
of the structures mentioned in Section 459 shall be 
deemed to be a building within the meaning of this 
section. 
Elements 
The elements of Possession of Burglary Tools: 
1. The possession of certain tools 
2. Required intent: 
a. with the intent to break or enter any 
building or structure mentioned in P.C. 
459 (Burglary); 
b. knowingly make or attempt to make a 
key or other instrument to fit another 
building without legal request; 
c. the failure by a maker to ascertain the 
right to open or make or alter, or repair any 
instrument or thing; or 
d. knowing or having reason to believe 
that the tool(s) is (are) intended to be used 
in committing a misdemeanor or felony. 
Discussion 
Possession of burglary tools is a criminal 
offense if one of the four types of intent listed 
above is present. Subparagraphs a and b require a 
specific intent, whereas c and d require only a 
general intent. 
6.7 Sale of Burglar Tools 
Penal Code 466.1 Sale of Burglar Tools-Infor­
mation to Be Retained 
Any person who knowingly and willfully sells 
or provides a lock pick, a tension bar, a lock pick 
gun, a tubular lock, or a floor-safe door puller, to 
another,. whether or not for compensation, shall 
obtain the name, address, telephone number, if 

Burglary 65 
any, date of birth and driver's license number or 
identification number, if any, of the person to 
whom the device is sold or provided and the 
signature of the person to whom the device was 
sold or provided, shall be set forth on a bill of sale 
or receipt. A copy. of each bill of sale or receipt 
shall be retained for one year and shall be open for 
inspection by any peace officer during business 
hours. 
Any person who violates any provision of this 
section is guilty of a misdemeanor. 
6.8 Vending Machine Theft 
Penal Code 466.3 Vending Machine Theft 
(a) Whoever possesses a key, tool, instru­
ment, explosive, or device, or a drawing, print, or 
mold of a key, tool, instrument, explosive, or 
device, designed to open, break into, tamper with, 
or damage a coin-operated machine as defined in 
subdivision (b), with the intent to commit a theft 
from such machine, is punishable by imprison­
ment in the county jail . . . . 
(b) As used in this section, the tenn "coin­
operated machine" shall include any automatic 
vending machine or any part thereof, parking 
meter, coin telephone, coin laundry machine, coin 
dry cleaning machine, amusement machine,

goods or services, or moneychanger. 
6.9 Othler Related Crimes 
Listed below are related crimes involving the 
possession, use of, or making of duplicate keys. 
The below discussed crimes are misdemeanors. 
Penal Code 466.6-requires that anyone who 
makes a motor vehicle key made other than by 
duplication of an existing key must keep certain 
records regarding the person who requested the 
making of the key. 
Penal Code 466.7 makes it unlawful to pos­
sess a key made other than by duplication with the 
intent to use it in the commission of an unlawful 
act. 
Penal Code 466.8 requires that anyone who 
makes a key capable of opening a building by any 
method involving an onsite inspection of the building must keep certain records regarding the 
person who requested the making of the key. 
Penal Code 469 makes it a crime to duplicate 
any key to a building or other area owned, oper­
ated or controlled by the State of California with­
out proper authorization.

7.1 Arson 
Penal Code 450 Definition of Terms 
In this chapter, the following terms have the 
following meanings: 
(a) "Structure" means any building, or com~ 
mercialor public tent, bridge, tunnel, or 
powerplant. 
(b) "Forest land" means any brush covered 
land, cut~over land, forest, grasslands, or woods. 
67 (c) "Property" means real property or per~ 
sonal property, other than a structure or forest 
land. 
(d) "Inhabited" means currently being used 
for dwelling purposes whether occupied or not. 
"Inhabited structure" and "inhabited property" 
do not include the real property on which an 
inhabited structure or an inhabited property is 
located. 
(e) "Maliciously" imports a wish to vex, 
defraud, annoy, or injure another person, or an 
intent to do a wrongful act, established either by 
proof or presumption of law. 
(f) "Recklessly" means a person is aware of 
and consciously disregards a substantial and 
unjustifiable risk that his or her act will set fire to, 
bum, or cause to burn a structure, forest land, or 
property. The risk shall be of such nature and 
degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross 
deviation from the standard of conduct that a 
reasonable person would observe in the situation. 
A person who creates such a risk but is unaware 
thereof by reason of voluntary intoxication also 
acts recklessly with respect thereto. 
Arson Defined 
Under early common law, arson was a crime 
against the home. It consisted of the willful and 
malicious burning of another person's dwelling 
and/or surrounding buildings. The burning could 

68 Chapter 7 
be either day or night, but a burning at night was 
the more serious crime. Arson was considered as a 
crime against the security of the home. Arson was 
a common law felony. Similar to present day 
arson, the word "malicious" did not require ill 
will or hate. California, like most other states, has 
expanded the definition of arson to include the 
burning of other structures, forest land and other 
types of property. 
Elements of Arson 
The elements of arson are: 
1. Setting fire to or burns or causes to be 
burned or who aids, counsels or procures 
the burning of 
2. any structure, forest land or property 
3. by the intentional act of the accused 
Discussion 
For the purposes of arson related crimes, 
willful means an intentional act. Maliciousness 
means orJy that the setting of the fire was inten­
tional and deliberate. A fire is started willful and 
maliciously when the ac~used intentionally and 
deliberately sets fire to the building (People v. 
Green 146 CA 3d 369). 
A fire that is started accidentally or uninten­
tionally is not considered as the result of willful 
and maliciousness conduct. Arson is not estab­
lished unless it is shown that the fire was of 
incendiary rather than accidental origin. 
The malicious intent of the defendant must be 
malicious only in the sense that his is a mind set on 
doing an intentional wrong. In the Green case 
(cited above), the defendant set fire to his wife's 
apartment, and the fire spread to the carport and 
destroyed a car parked in the carport. The defen­
dant contended that he should not be convicted of 
arson of the car, since he did not intend to burn it. 
The court held that the fire was set willfully and 
maliciously, and the fact that some of the results of 
the fire were unintentional was ilTelevant. 
In the majority of cases, the willful and mali­
cious intent is established by circumstantial evi­
dence. For example, in a case where the firemen 
found the windows closed, shades drawn, doors 
locked, a smell of kerosene, and fire starting in 
three different rooms, the jury's finding that the fire was intentionally set was upheld on appeal 
(People v. Patello 13 P 2d 1068). 
In another case, the court considered the fact 
that the accused had financial problems, most of 
his personal effects had been removed from the 
house shortly before the fire, and the house was 
over-insured as evidence that the owner of the 
house had wilfully set fire to the house (People v. 
Freeman 135 CA 2d 11). 
In People v. Nance, 25 CA 3d 925, the court 
held that the defense of diminished capacity was 
not a defense to the charge of arson. In this 
decision, the court stated that arson does not 
require a specific mental state as long as the 
burning involved is intentional. In another case, 
the police were notified of the ac.cused's plan to 
burn a building. The police hid nearby until the 
accused started the fire and then 1\rrested him for 
arson. The court stated that the actions of the 
police did not excuse the accused nor did the facts 
negate the accused's malicious intent (People v. 
Greening 102 C 384). 
An accused was found guilty of willfully and 
maliciously causing a dwelling to burn where he 
intentionally set fire to a nearby building which 
spread to the dwelling. His conviction was upheld 
even though there was evidence that the burning 
of the dwelling was not intended (People v. Hiltel 
131 C 577). 
Motive 
Motive is not an essential element of the 
offense of arson. TIle presence of motive may, 
however, be important in proving the presence of a 
wrongful intent. Lack of motive may be used by 
the defendant to dispute the presence of the 
required intent. 
Burning 
To constitute a burning, no outbreak of flame 
is necessary, but some part of the building, etc. 
must be at least charred. A burning, however 
slight, is sufficient to meet this requirement. For 
exam pIe, the floor of a building that is charred in a 
single place is considered as a "burning" (People 
v. Haggerty 46 C 354). Some fibers, however, 
must be destroyed to constitute a burning. Mere 

Arson, Vandalism and Disorderly Conduct 69 
blacldng of the wood was held to be insufficient to 
establish a burning (People v. Simpson 50 C 304). 
The accused was convicted of arson of a 
building made of marble, plaster and concrete. He 
had contended that this building, a mausoleum, 
was incapable of burning. The court held that 
since part of the marble floor was destroyed by 
"spawling," a conviction of arson was proper. 
Note: "spawling" is the disintegration of marble 
by heat. (People v. Mentzer 163 CA 3d 482.) 
Burning Own Property 
A person who bums his/her own property 
may be convicted of arson under PC 451, if the 
burning was with the intent to defraud or when it 
results in injury to property of others. The intent 
to defraud situation often involves the burning of 
insured property with the intent to collect an 
insurance recovery. In cases involving protected 
forest lands, an individual may, also, be guilty of 
arson when he or she deliberately bums their own 
protective forest land. 
The restrictions and limitations placed on an 
?wner's right to dispose of his or her own property 
IS a valid exercise of a state's "police power" 
(People v. George 42 CA 2d 568). 
Structures, Forest Land and Property 
The arson statute covers structures of any 
type, forest land and any other type of property. 
The term "property" includes both real and per­
sonal property. Apparently, "personal property" 
does not include intangible personal property. 
"Intangible personal property" are items like 
stocks, bonds, deeds, etc. 
Inhabited 
As discussed later, burning of an inhabited 
structure is considered as a more serious offense 
and greater maximum punishment than the burn­
ing of an uninhabited one. The increased punish­
ment schedule is based on the theory that there is a 
greater danger of injury or death when an inhab­
ited stmcture is burned. 
The defendant was convicted of arson of an 
inhabited structure based on the fact that the 
apartment that he set fire to had been vacated 
several days earlier. The court stated that for the purposes of arson, PC 450 defines' 'inhabited" as 
"currently being used for dwelling purposes 
whether occupied or not." Therefore, the legisla­
tive intent was to cover stmctures likely to be 
inhabited because of the danger to human life. 
(People v. Green 146 C 3d 369). (Note: the term 
"inhabited" has a slightly different meaning for 
arson than for burglary.) 
7.2 Unlawfully Causing a Fire 
Penal Code 452 
A person is guilty of unlawfully causing a fire 
when he recklessly sets fire to or bums or causes 
to be burned, any structure, forest land or prop­
erty. [Subparagraphs (a) to (e) of statute omitted] 
Discussion 
The only difference between P C 451 and 452 
is that under P C 451, the fire is the result of a 
"willful and malicious" act whereas under P C 
452, the fire is the result of "recklessness". To be 
guilty of this offense, the accused must "reck­
lessly" set fire to or bum or cause to be burned any 
structure, etc. An accused's conduct was not con­
sidered as "reckless" when he negligently built a 
small campfire which was the source of a large 
fire after an unprecedented wind force developed. 
To be guilty of this offense, the court ruled that the 
accused must consciously disregard the risk 
involved so as to characterize his conduct as 
reckless (People v. Budish 131 CA 3d 1043). 
Since this crime is considered as an "uninten­
tional" crime, a person may not be convicted of an 
attempt to commit this offense (In re Kent W. 181 
CA 3d 721). The court, in In re Kent W, held that 
since an attempt requires the specific intent to 
commit the target offense, that it was logically 
impossible to specifically intend an unintentional 
result. Accordingly, there could be no such crime 
as attempting to recklessly start an unlawful fire. 
7.3 Possession of Flammable, Explosive or 
Combustible Material 
Penal Code 453 
(a) Every person who possesses any flamm­
able, explosive or combustible material or sub­
stance, or any device in an arrangement or 

70 Chapter 7 
preparation, with intent to willfully and mali­
ciously use such material, substance, forest land 
or property, is punishable by imprisonment in the 
state prison or in the county jail, not exceeding 
one year. 
(b) Every person who possesses, manufac­
tures or disposes of a firebomb is guilty of a 
felony. 
For purposes of this subdivision, "disposes 
of' means to give, give away, loan, offer, offer for 
sale, sell or transfer. 
For purposes of this subdivision, a "fire­
bomb" is a breakable container containing a flam­
mable liquid with a flashpoint of 150 degrees 
Fahrenheit or less, having a wick or similar device 
capable of being ignited, but no device commer­
cially manufactured primarily for the purpose of 
illumination shall be a firebomb for the purpose of 
this subdivision. [Subparagraph (c) which 
exempts fire departments, military persons and 
police possessing the above material in the course 
of their duties is omitted.] 
Discussion 
In People v. Diamond (2 CA 3d 860), the 
defendant was convicted of the possession of a 
combustible substance when three firebombs 
were found in his automobile near a downtown 
mall during a period of racial unrest. 
7.4 Attempted Arson 
Penal Code 453 
(a) Any person who willfully and maliciously 
attempts to set fire to or attempts to bum or to aid, 
counselor procure the burning of any structure, 
forest land, or who commits any act preliminary 
thereto, orin furtherance thereof, is punishable by 
imprisonment in the state prison. . . . 
Discussion 
The placing or distribution of any flammable, 
explosive or combustible material or substance, or 
any device in or about any structure, forest land or 
property in an arrangement or preparation with 
intent to eventually willfully and maliciously set 
fire to or bum same or to procure the setting fire to 
or burning of the same shall, for the purposes of 
this act constitute an attempt to bum such struc­
ture, forest land or property. 7.S Psychiatric Examination 
Frequently, arson related offenses are com­
mitted by persons with emotional disorders. 
Accordingly, Penal Code 457 permits the court to 
order a psychiatric examination of anyone con­
victed of an arson related offense. In addition, 
Penal Code 457.1 requires that persons convicted 
of arson or attempted arson may be required by the 
court to register with the chief of police or sheriff. 
7.6 Notice ofRek't!~tse of Arsonist 
P C 11150 Requires that prior to the release of 
a person convicted of arson, the Director of Cor­
rections shall notify in writing the State Fire 
Marshall and all police departments and the sher­
iff in the county in which the person was convicted 
and, if known, the county in which he or she is 
released to. P C 11151 requires similar notification 
by the Director of Mental Hygiene within five 
days of the release from a state mental institution 
or hospital of a person convicted of arson. 
7.7 Vandalism 
Penal Code 594 provides that any person is 
guilty of vandalism who: 
1. defaces with paint or any other liquid, 
2. damages, or 
3. destroys any real or personal property not 
his own. 
The amount of defacement, damage or 
destruction determines whether or not the crime 
is a felony or misdemeanor. If the amount of 
damage is less than $5,000, the offense is a 
misdemeanor. If the amount is $5,000 or more the 
offense is a "wobbler." 
Penal Code 594.3 provides that any person 
who knowingly commits any act of vandalism to a 
church, synagogue, building owned and occupied 
by a religious education institution, or other place 
primarily used as a place of worship where 
religious services are regularly conducted is guilty 
of vandalism of a church and is punish(l.ble by 
continement in the county jail or state prison (a 
wobbler). 
Note: Education Code, Section 48905 deals 
with vandalism of school property. Its provisions 
are similar to those noted above. In addition, 

Arson, Vandalism and Disorderly Conduct 71 
Education Code, Section 48904 and Civil Code 
Section 1714.1 impose civil liability on parents or 
guardians for the vandalism of the child. 
7.8 Disorderly Conduct 
Penal Code 647 provides, in part, that a 
person is guilty of a misdemeanor who does one of 
the below listed acts: 
Lewd or Dissolute Oonduct -Solicits 
anyone to engage in or who engages in 
lewd or dissolute conduct in any public 
place or in any place open to the public or 
exposed to public view. 
Prostitution -Solicits or who agrees to 
engage in or who engages in any act of 
prostitution. For purposes of Penal Code 
647, prostitution includes any lewd act 
between persolils for money or other 
consideration. 
Begging -Accosts other persons in any 
public place or in any place open to the 
public for the purposes of begging or solic­
iting alms. 
Loitering -Who loiters, prowls or 
wanders upon the private property of 
another, at any time, without visible or 
lawful business with the owner or occu­
pant thereof. 
Peeping -Who, while loitering, prowl­
ing, or wandering upon the private prop­
erty of another, at any time, peeks in the 
door or window of any inhabited building 
or structure without visible or lawful busi­
ness with the owner or occupant of the 
building or structure. 
Who lodges in any building. structure, 
vehicle or place, whether public or privat.e, 
without the permission of the owner or 
person entitled to the possession or control 
thereof. (Note: "public place" includes 
any park, street, or building open to the 
public:, or any public offices.) 
"Solicit" means to strongly urge, to entice or 
lure, especially into evil, attempt to seduce, or to 
accost for an immoral purpose (p C 648). 
7.9 Trespassing 
Penal Code 1\)02 provides that a person is guilty of trespassing (misdemeanor) who enters 
and occupies real property or structures without 
consent from the owner or person in lawful pos­
session. Transient noncontinuous possession is 
not considered as occupying (People v. Catalano 
29 C 3d 1). While mere presence on private 
property may not be a trespass, the refusing to 
leave private property not open to the public after 
being asked to leave by the owner or by a peace 
officer at the owner's request is a trespass (People 
v. Medrano 78 CA 3d 198). 
There is no trespass if the private property is 
open to the general public, unless the property is 
being used in a manner not related to the purpose 
for which it is open to the public (People v. 
Lundgren 189 CA 3d 381). 
7.10 Unlawful Assembly 
Penal Code 407 provides, in part, that when­
ever two or more persons assemble together to do 
an unlawful act, or do a lawful act in a violent, 
boisterous, or tumultuous manner, such assembly 
is an unlawful assembly. This is a specific intent 
crime, since those assembled must intend to com­
mit an unlawful act, or a lawful act in a violent, 
boisterous or tumultuous manner. Violation of the 
penal section is a misdemeanor. 
7.11 Rout/Riot 
Penal Code 404 and 406 deal with riots. 
Section 406 provides that whenever two or more 
persons, assembled and acting together, make an 
attempt to advance toward the commission of an 
act which would be a riot, if actually committed, 
that the assembly is a rout. 
Section 404 provides that any use of force or 
violence, disturbing the public peace, or any threat 
to use such force or violence, if accompanied by 
immediate power of execution, by two or more 
persons acting together, and without authority of 
law, is a riot. The group must be acting together 
with a common intent. There must be at least 
threats to use force or violence which is apparently 
available. In addition, the threats or use of force 
must actually disturb the peace. Public peace is 
considered "disturbed" when the actions of the 
group excite terror, alarm, and consternation in 
the neighborhood. Note: P C 404.6 prohibits 

72 Chapter 7 
urging others to riot or to bum or otherwise to 
destroy property. 
7.12 Public Nuisance 
P C 370 defines a public nuisance as anything 
which: 
1. is injurious to health, 
2. or is indecent, 
3. or offensive to the senses, 
4. or an obstruction to the free use of 
property, 
(a) so as to interfere with the comfortable 
enjoyment of life or property 
(b) by an entire community or 
neighborhood, 
(c) or by any considerable number of 
persons, 
5. or unlawfully obstructs, the free passage 
or use, in the customary manner, 
(d) of (lny navigable lake, 
(b) or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin, 
(c) or any public park, square, street, 
(d) or highway is a public nuisance. 
P C 372 states (in part) that every person who 
maintains or commits any public nuisance or who 
willfully omits to perform any legal duty relating 
to the removal of a public nuisance, is guilty of a 
misdemeanor. A "nuisance" can be an act, condi­
tion, thing or person causing trouble, annoyance, 
or inconvenience. Before prosecution may be had 
under PC 372, the accused must be given notice 
to abate the public nuisance and an opportunity to 
do so. 
7.13 Disturbing the Peace 
P C 415 defines three types of disturbing the 
peace crimes. The three are as follows: 
1. Unlawfully fighting or challenging 
another person to fight in a public place. 
2. Maliciously and willfully disturbing 
another person by loud and unreasonable 
noise. 
3. Using offensive words in a public place 
which are likely to produce an immediate 
violent reaction. 
PC 415.5 is similar to PC 415, except that it 
applies only to buildings and grounds of any public school, elementary school, community col­
lege, state college, etc. Note: P C 415.5 does not 
apply to any person who is registered as a student 
of the school where the disturbance took place. 
The crime of disturbing the peace is a 
misdemeanor.

8.1 Definition of Assault and Battery 
An assault is an attempt to inflict violent 
injury upon another person by some form of 
contact. If the violent injury is actually inflicted or 
contact is made upon the person of another, then 
the crime is a battery. An assault is an attempt to 
commit a battery. Accordingly, one may be con­
victed of an assault even if the evidence establishes 
that a battery was committed (People v. Whalen 
124 CA 2d 713). 
8.2 Assault 
Penal Code 240 Assault-Defined 
An assault is an unlawful attempt, coupled 
with a present ability, to commit a violent injury 
on the person of another. 
Elements 
The elements of the crime of assault are: 
1. an unlawful attempt 
2. with the (apparent) present ability 
3. to commit an injury to the person of 
another. 

76 Chapter 8 
8.3 Battery 
Penal Code 242 Battery-Defined 
A battery is any willful and unlawful use of 
force or violence upon the person of another. 
Elements 
The Elements of the crime of battery are: 
1. The willful and unlawful 
2. use of force or violence 
3. against the person of another. 
8.4 Discussion of Assault and Battery 
Crimes 
To constitute an assault, the attempt to com­
mit a violent injury must be unlawful. For exam­
ple, an attempt to commit a violent injury in a 
prize fight or in self-defense is not normally 
unlawful and thus, not an assault. It is also not an 
assault if the act is made with the consent of the 
victim (People v. Gordon 70 C 467). 
Required Intent 
To constitute the offense of an assault under 
Califomia statutes, there must be an intent to 
inflict violent injury against another, and a direct 
act toward carrying out that intent. Accordingly, 
an individual cannot "accidentally" commit an 
assault. Reckless conduct, but without the intent 
to commit violent injury, on the part of an accused 
is not an assault (People v. Barnes 101 CA 3d 341). 
In that case, the court held that the intent neces­
sary to commit an assault is the intent to commit a 
battery. The intent to commit a battery, however, 
may be implied from the act. The general rule is 
that it is enough that the act be intentional and 
unlawful. There is no requirement to prove an 
intent to injure. 
Present Ability 
The direct act is, also, dependent on the 
present ability of the offender to carry out the 
intended injury. If the individual does not have the 
present ability to commit a violent injury, then 
there is no assault. The belief of the victim as to 
the ability of the defendant to commit the assault 
is immaterial (People v. Mosqueda 5 CA 3d 540). 
Pointing an unloaded gun at a person in a 
threatening manner is not an assault under Califor­
nia law since there is no present ability to commit a battery. (Note: this maybe a violationofP C417, 
threatening with a weapon.) 
In People v. Ranson (40 CA 3d 317), the 
accused pointed a loaded weapon at the victim. 
The top caItridge was improperly loaded causing 
the weapon to jam. The court held that the defen­
dant had "present ability" to commit a violent 
injury since he could have quickly cleared the jam 
and fired the weapon. In a similar case, the present 
ability was present where an automatic weapon 
without a round in the firing chamber, but with a 
loaded magazine, was pointed at the victim. 
Violent Injury 
The phrase' 'violent injury" is misleading. For 
purposes of the assault and battery crimes, "vio­
lent injury" has a special meaning. It is not the 
same as "bodily harm." Actual bodily harm is not 
required. The term "violent injury" includes any 
wrongful act committed by means of physical 
force agaim;t the person of another. An offensive 
touching is sufficient. The "violent injury" 
referred to may be only to the dignity of the 
person. The kind of physical force used is imma­
terial. The act of spitting at another or attempting 
to touch someone in an offensive manner is con­
sidered sufficient. 
In one case, a conviction of battery was upheld 
on evidence that the accused pushed on the door of 
an office to prevent the victim from closing the 
door. The court stated that the closing of the door 
while it was touching the "victim" could be 
deemed an offensive touching (People v. Puckett 
44 CA 3d 607). 
It is not important that the victim "fear" the 
violent injury. If for example, you were to take a 
swing at close range with your fist at a heavy 
weight boxing champion, that conduct would con­
stitute an assault. It does not matter that the boxer 
did not fear your assault. 
Battery on Peace Officers 
It is a felony (wobbler) to commit a battery: 
1. on the person of: 
a. a peace officer, 
b. firefighter, 
c. an emergency medical person, 
d. a custodial officer, 

Assault/Battery and Deadly Weapons Law 77 
e. a process server, and 
f. operator or passenger of transporta­
tion for hire vehicle. (PC 243.3) 
2. when the victim is engaged in the per­
formance of his/her official duties; and 
3. the offender knows or should reasonably 
know that the victim is one of the above 
persons. 
8.5 Attempted Assault 
As noted earlier, an assault is an attempted 
battery. An attempted assault, however, is not a 
crime (In re James 9 CA 3d 517). For example, 
threats of injury without the present ability to 
commit a battery is not an assault -nor is the 
leering at a woman. 
8.6 Simple and Felonious Assaults 
Simple Assault 
Simple assault is the popular term used to 
denote a misdemeanor assault (People v. Egan 91 
CA 44). To constitute a simple assault, there must 
be an ability and an attempt to commit the offense. 
Basically, it is an assault without any aggravating 
factors such as a completed battery or assault with 
a dangerous weapon. It is also a lessor included 
offense to other types of assault. For example, if 
the accused is tried for assault with the intent to 
commit rape and the State proves an assault but 
cannot establish the intent to commit the rape, the 
accused may be convicted of at least simple 
assault. 
Felonious Assault 
Felonious assault describes those assaults that 
are committed with the intent to commit a felony. 
For example, some of the more common felonious 
assaults are: 
1. assault with a deadly weapon; 
2. battery with serious bodily injury; 
3. sexual battery; 
4. assault with intent to commit mayhem, 
rape, sodomy or oral copulation; and 
5. assault on a peace officer in the perfor­
mance of duty; 8.7 Motor Vehicle Assaults 
Penal Code 417.3 Drawing or Exhibiting Fire­
arm to Person in Motor Vehicle 
Every person who, except in self-defense, in 
the presence of any other person who is an occu­
pant of a motor vehicle proceeding on a public 
street or highway, draws or exhibits any firearm, 
whether loaded or unloaded, in a threatening 
manner against another person in such a way as to 
cause a reasonable person apprehension or fear 
bodily harm is guilty of a felony. 
Nothing in this stanIte shall preclude or pro­
hibit prosecution under any other statute. 
Discussion 
PC 417.3 was enacted by the Legislanlre in 
1987 as a direct result of the "freeway" shootings 
in Southern California, which later spread to other 
parts of the State. It is assumed that the phrase 
"proceeding on a public street or highway" 
includes those situations where the motor vehicles 
are stopped in traffic because of traffic lights or 
traffic problems. Note: the offense may be com­
mitted with either a "loaded" or "unloaded" 
weapon. 
P C 12034 makes it a misdemeanor to dis­
charge a firearm from a motor vehicle. If the 
weapon is discharged at another person, the crime 
is a felony. Note: P C 246.1, also, provides that any 
person who maliciously and willfully discharges a 
firearm at an inhabited dwelling, house, occupied 
motor vehicle or inhabited housecar is guilty of a 
felony (wobbler). 
8.8 Assau" --'-It Deadly Weapon 
Penal Code 24, 
(1) Every p..!ion who commits an assault 
upon the person of another with a deadly weapon 
or instrument other than a firearm or by any force 
likely to produce great bodily injury is punishable 
by imprisonment in the state prison ... or in a 
county jail not exceeding one year, or by fine ... 
or by both such fine and imprisonment. 
(2) Every person who commits an assault 
upon the person of another with a firearm is 
punishable by imprisonment in the state prison .. . 
or in a county jail ... or by both a fine and .. . 
imprisonment. 

78 Chapter 8 
Elements 
The elements of an assault with a deadly 
weapon are: 
1. An unlawful attempt to commit a violent 
injury 
2. Upon the person of another 
3. With the present ability 
4. Using a deadly weapon or a force likely to 
produce great bodily injury. 
Discussion 
There are two different crimes. The first 
involves the use of a deadly weapon and the 
second is the use of force (with or withm!t a 
weapon) in a means likely to produce great bodily 
injury. 
A deadly weapon can be any object capable of 
causing death or great bodily injury from the 
manner in which it is used. For example, hitting 
the person over the head with an unloaded pistol 
could cause great bodily injury, and therefore, is 
a deadly weapon, whereas the pointing of an . 
unloaded rifle at a person would not. To be gUilty 
of this offense, it is not necessary for an actual 
injury to result from the assault. 
To determine if the weapon used is a deadly 
weapon, the nature of the weapon, the manner of 
its use, the location of the person at which the 
weapon was directed and the injury, if any, 
inflicted will be considered. 
Any physical force that is capable of produc­
ing great bodily injury is sufficient for purposes 
of the deadly force requirement. If the victim is 
injured and no weapon is found, the nature of the 
victim's injury may justify an inference that a 
dangerous weapon was used. 
This offense is not a special intent crime. For 
example, one accused was convicted of an assault 
with a deadly weapon for pointing a loaded pistol 
at the victim. There is no requirement to establish 
that the accused intended to use the weapon. 
Also,the firing of a pistol in the direction of the 
victim without an intent to hit the victim, but to 
only "scare him" is an assault with a deadly 
weapon (People v. McCoy 25 CA 2d 518). 
S.9 Assault With the Intent to Commit May­
hem, Rape, Sodomy, or Oral Copulation 
Penal Code 220 
Every person who assaults another with intent to commit mayhem, rape, sodomy, oral copula­
tion, or any violation of Section 264.1,288 or 289 
is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison. 
[Note: sections 264.1,288 and 289 pertain to rape 
and other sexual offenses.] 
Elements 
are: The elements of the crime of felonious assault 
1. An unlawful attempt to commit a violent 
injury upon the person of another 
2. with the present ability 
3. with the specific intent to commit may­
hem, rape, sodomy, oral copulation or any 
of the sexual offenses listed in Sections 
264.1, 288 or 289 of the Penal Code. 
S.10 Mayhem 
Penal Code 203 Mayhem Defined 
Every person who unlawfully and maliciously 
deprives a human being of a member of his body, 
or disables, disfigures, or renders it useless, or 
cuts or disables the tongue, or puts out an eye, or 
slits the nose, ear, or lip, is guilty of mayhem. 
Penal Code 205 Aggravated Mayhem 
A person is guilty of aggravated mayhem 
when he or she unlawfully. under circumstances 
manifesting extreme indifference to the physical 
or psychological well-being of another person, 
intentionally causes permanent disability or dis­
figurement of another humanlleing or deprives a 
human being of a limb, organ, or mem ber of his or 
her body. For purposes of this section, it is not 
necessary to prove an intent to kill. Aggravated 
mayhem is a felony punishable by imprisonment 
in the state prison for life with the possibility of 
parole. 
Elements 
The elements of mayhem are: 
1. An unlawful battery, 
2. maliciously inflicting, or attempting to 
inflict violent injury, and 
3. one or more described injuries as a result 
of above action. 
Discussion 
Mayhem is a fODn of aggravated battery (Peo­
ple v. DeFoor 100 C 150). Unlike assault with the 

Assault/Battery and Deadly Weapons Law 79 
intent to commit mayhem, there is no requirement 
of a specific intent to inflict the resulting injury. 
For example, one defendant was convicted of 
mayhem when he hit the victim in the head, 
breaking his glasses and destroying the sight in 
one eye. No evidence, however, was presented 
regarding an intent to destroy the eyesight (People 
v. Wright 93 C 564 and People v. Vigil 242 CA 2d 
862). 
The nature of the injuries involved in mayhem 
convictions include: 
1. 
biting off the nose, or pOltion thereof, 
2. cutting off a piece of a.n ear or a portion of 
a lip, 
3. rendering an eye useless for practical 
purposes, 
4. disabling the tongue by biting it, and 
5. biting through the lip ("slit"). 
Aggravated mayhem was created by the legis­
lature in 1987 for punishing those who peIma­
nently disable or disfigure victims. Offenders 
convicted of this offense may be sentenced to life 
imprisonment. 
8.11 Spousal or Cohabitant Battery 
Penal Code 273.5 Felony to Inflict Corporal 
Injury on Spouse or Cohabitant 
(a) Any person who willfully inflicts upon his 
or her spouse, or any person who willfully in­
flicts upon any person of the opposite sex with 
whom he or she is cohabiting, or any person 
who willfully inflicts upon any person who is the 
mother or father or his or her child, corporal 
injury resulting in a traumatic condition, is guilty 
of a felony .... 
(b) Holding oneself out to be the husband or 
wife of the person with whom one is cohabiting is 
not necessary to constitute cohabitation as the 
term is used in this section. 
(c) As used in this section, "traumatic condi­
tion" means a condition of the body, such as a 
wound or external or internal injury, whether of a 
minor or serious nature, caused by a physical 
force. [penal Code 12028.5 peImits law enforce­
ment personnel to take possession of any fireaIms 
at the scene of a domestic violence incident.] 
[The Domestic Violence Prevention Act 
(Code of Civil Procedure, Sections 540-533) 
allows any family member who can show that he 
or she has been abused in the past by a spouse or 
other member of the household to obtain a tempo­
rary restraining order (TRO) to prevent further 
violence. Violation of a TRO is a misdemeanor 
under P C 273.6.] 
8.12 Child, Spouse, or Parent Abuse or 
Neglect 
Child Abuse 
Penal Code 273a(1) makes it a felony (wob­
bIer) to willfully abuse a child under circum­
stances likely to produce great bodily hann or 
death. The types of abuse covered by this section 
include: 
1. Willfully causing or pennitting the child 
to suffer unjustifiable physical pain or 
mental suffering. 
2. Having custody of the child, willfully per­
mitting thl~ child to be placed in a situation 
that endangers the person or health of the 
child. 
3. Having custody of the child, willfully 
causes or peImits the child to be injured. 
P C 273a(2) makes it a misdemeanor in the . 
above cases, if the circumstances or conditions are 
other than those likely to produce great bodily 
hann or death. 
Child Abuse Reporting 
Penal Code 11166 provides that: 
1. any child care custodial, 
2. medical practitioner, 
3. non-medical practitioner, or 
4. employee of one of the above who has 
knowledge or reasonably suspects that a 
child is a victim of child abuse shall: 
a. immediately report, by telephone, the 
abuse to a child protection agency, and 
b. fonow-up with a written report within 36 
hours. 

80 Chapter 8 
Note: the above reporting requirement does 
not include child abuse by other than physical 
means. For example it does not include mental 
abuse or endangerment of ,emotional well being. 
Child Neglect 
Penal Code 270 provides for punishment of 
parents and guardians of any child who fail with­
out a lawful excuse to furnish the necessary food, 
clothing and shelter for his or her child. That 
section, also, provides punishment for the aban­
donment or desertion of a child by a parent or a 
guardian. Note: that criminal conduct is present 
only when there is "no lawful excuse" for the 
failure to provide the necessary care. The inability 
to provide the necessary care is, in most cases, a 
defense to child abuse. 
Other penal statutes involving neglect or 
abandonment of child are: 
1. P C 270f provides for the reporting and 
investigation of failure to support a minor 
child. 
2. P C 2705 makes it a misdemeanor to 
refuse to accept your child in your home 
without just cause. 
3. P C 272 makes it a crime to contribute to 
the delinquency of a minor. 
4. P C 273 makes it a misdemeanor to pay 
money or give any thing of value to a 
parent for the adoption of a child. (Note: 
medical, hospital or birth related expenses 
may be paid by the adopting parent.) 
Neglect of Spouse 
P C 270a makes it a misdemeanor for an 
individual who has sufficient ability to provide for 
his or her spouse's support to fail to provide the 
necessary support. An exception to the obligation 
to support exists in those cases where the conduct 
of the other spouse is such that the individual was 
justified in abandoning such spouse. 
Neglect of Parent 
Civil Code 206 establishes a reciprocal duty 
of support for parent and child. Accordingly, the 
parent or child has a duty to support the other if 
the other is unable to maintain himself or herself. 
PC 207c provides that the failure of an adult child 
to support an indigent parent is a misdemeanor. 8.13 Dangerous Weapons' Control Law

Chapter 9 
Homicide 
Truth will come to light; murder cannot be hid long. (Shakespeare, 
Merchant a/Venice) 
Homicide Related Crimes 
1. Murder in the first degree 
2. Murder in the second degree 
3. Voluntary Manslaughter 
4. Involuntary Manslaughter 
5. Aiding Another to Commit Suicide 
9.1 Homicide Defined 
Homicide is the killing of a human being by 
another human. Not all homicides are crimes. For 
example, excusable homicides and justifiable 
homicides are not crimes. These will be discussed 
later in this chapter. Criminal homicides are those 
homicides that are crimes, mainly murder and 
manslaughter. 
9.2 Criminal Homicides 
Criminal homicides are classified as: 
1. Murder 
a. First degree murder 
b. Second degree murder 
2. Manslaughter 
a. Voluntary 
b. Involuntary 
c. Vehicular 
The circumstances surrounding the killing 
and the mental state of the actor determines in 
most cases the type of criminal homicide involved 
(People v. Mar Gin Suie 11 CA 42). All criminal 
homicides are considered "mala in se" (evil in 
itself) crimes (People v. Herbert 6 C 2d 541). 
85 Corpus Delicti 
The literal meaning of the term "corpus 
delicti" is "body of the crime." In criminal homi­
cide, the corpus delicti is the death of a human 
being under criminal circumstances. "Corpus 
delicti" is basically the required elements of a 
particular crime. 
The elements of criminal homicide are: 
1. A criminal activity (either act or 
omission) 
2. Resulting in the killing of another human 
being. 
The Killing of A Live Person 
The above elements include the requirement 
that the human being was" alive" at the time of the 
act (People v. Smith 215 C 749). A person, 
however, who has suffered a mortal wOU!ld and 
will die shortly, may still be the victim of a 
criminal homicide by the infliction of a new injury 
that hastens his death. For example,if the 
deceased attempts to kill himself and inflicts grave 
injuries on himself, the act of another in putting 
the deceased out of his misery is considered a 
criminal homicide. (People v. Lewis 124 C 551). 
Whether the killing of a fetus in a woman's 
body is a homicide depends on the viability of the 
fetus. A fetus is "viable" ifit is capable ofsurviv­
ing the trauma of birth and living outside of the 
womb. It does not matter if the birth is assisted by 
artificial medical treatment or that the fems must 

86 Chapter 9 
be sustained on machines; as long as it is capable 
of existing independently of the mother (People v. 
Apodaca 76 CA 3d 479). The killing of viable 
fetus is not criminal homicide if an abortion is 
conducted under the Therapeutic Abortion Act or 
is required for the mother's safety. In most cases, 
the fetus is considered viable during the third tri­
semester (fmal three months) of the pregnancy. 
Note: there is no statutory crime of manslaughter 
of a fetus in California (People v. Apodaca, 76 
CA3d 479). 
Time Requirement 
At common law, the death must occur within 
one year and a day after the cause of the death. 
This has been modified by P C 194 which requires 
that the death occur within three years and one day 
after the cause. In those cases where there is a 
delay between the act or omission causing the 
death and the death, the date of the act, not the 
date of death, is used for legal purposes. For 
example, in the case of People v. Gill (6 C 63), the 
death occurred after the enactment of a new 
statute on criminal homicide, but the act causing 
the death was prior to the new law. The court held 
that since it was the date of the act, not date of 
death that controlled, the n.j:N law did not apply. 
Brain Death 
Inflicting an injury that would otherwise be a 
fatal injury is not a criminal homicide if the victim 
is already "brain dead" (People v. Lewis 124 C 
551). In California, the brain death concept is used 
as the definition of death. Health and Safety Code, 
Section 7180, describes death as the "the total and 
irreversible cessation of brain functions. " Accord­
ingly, once the determination of brain death has 
been made, the person is no longer alive, even if 
the body is still breathing. 
Proximate Cause 
Criminal homicide must be the result of an 
affirmative act, an omission to act, or criminal 
negligence. The act causing the death, however, 
need not be the only cause of death (People v. 
Fowler 178 C 657 and People v. Lewis 124 C 551). 
The death must be the proximate result of a 
human act. It need not, however, be the direct 
result. Proximate cause means that the death was a natural an.d probable consequence of the act. The 
test is "if the original act had not occurred, would 
the victim have died?" For example, if the victim 
is shot by the accused resulting in a non-fatal 
wound, but the victim dies on the operating table 
as the result of shock, the shooting is the "proxi­
mate cause" of the death (People v. Freudenberg 
121 CA 2d 564). In another case, People v. Moan 
(65 C 532), the victim being quite ill suffered an 
injury which accelerated his death. The injury was 
considered as the "proxinlate cause" of his death. 
9.3 Murder 
Penal Code 187 
(a) Murder is the unlawful killing of a human 
being, or a fetus, with malice aforethought. 
Penal Code 188 Express and Implied Malice­
No Other Mental State Needed to Establish 
Malice Aforethought 
Such malice may be "expressed" or 
"implied. " It is expressed when there is man­
ifested a deliberate intention unlawfully to take 
away the life of a fellow creature. It is implied, 
when no considerable provocation appears, or 
when the circumstances attending the killing show 
an "abandoned and malignant heart. " 
When it is shown that the killing resulted from 
the intentional doing of an act with expressed or 
implied malice as defmed above, no other mental 
state need be shown to establish malice 
aforethought .... [See: People v. Semone 140 CA 
318]. 
Penal Code 189 Murder of First or Second 
Degree 
All murder which is perpetrated by means of a 
destructive device or explosive, knowing use of 
ammunition designed primarily to penetrate metal 
or armor, poison, lying in wait, torture, or by any 
other kind of willful, deliberate, and premeditated 
killing, or which is committed in the perpetration 
of, or attempt to perpetrate, arson, rape, robbery, 
burglary, mayhem, or any act punishable under 
Section 288, is murder of the first degree; and all 
other kinds of murders are of the second degree. 
[Section 288 concerns lewd acts on a child under 
the age of 14.] 

------------
Homicide 87 
As used in this section,. "destructive device" 
shall mean any destructive device as defined in 
Section 12301, and "explosive" shall mean any 
explosive as defined in Section 12000 of the 
Health and Safety Code. To prove the killing was 
"deliberate and premeditated\," it shall not be 
necessary to prove the defendant maturely and 
meaningfully reflected upon the gravity of his or 
her act 
Malice Aforethought 
Malice aforethought is an essential element of 
the crime of murder (People v. Holt 25 C 2d 59). 
The difference between murder and manslaughter 
is the presence or absence of "malice 
aforethought. " The malice may be either 
expressed or implied. Except for those cases 
involving implied malice, there must either be an 
intent to kill or an intent to commit ac~s likely to 
kill with a conscious disregard for human life 
(people v. Washington 62 C 2d 777). 
For express malice, all that is required is the 
intent to kill. It does not require any ill will or 
hatred toward the victim (People v. Bendtr 27 C 2d 
164). The intent to kill may be formed at anytime 
prior to or at the time of the act. Accordingly, the 
intent to kill may be formed at the time that the 
death-causing act is administered (People v. Jam­
arillo 57 C 111). 
Transferred Intent 
Underthe "transferred intent" doctrine, if the 
accused intends to kill one person, but in attempt­
ing to do so kills another, the intent to kill is 
transferred to the actual victim. Accordingly, the 
accused may re convicted of murder of the other 
person (People v. Henderson 34 C 2d 340). In one 
case, the accused shot at his wife, missed her and 
killed a bystander. He was guilty of assault with 
the intent to murder (on the wife) and murder of 
the other person (People v. Brannon 70 C 225). 
Implied malice occurs when: 
1. no considerable provocation is present, 
2. when the circumstances indicate an aban­
doned and malignant heart, or 
3. the killing resulted from the intentional 
doing of an act likely to cause death or 
serious bodily injury. 
L ___ ~ Malice aforethought actually refers to the 
state of mind of the accused. It manifests itself in 
one of the following situations: 
1. The result of an act done with the specific 
irrfent to kill (expressed malice). 
2. Th,e result of an act done with the intent to 
produce serious bodily harm (expressed 
malice). 
3. The result of an act done during the per­
petration of or the attempt to commit one 
of the felonies listed in P C 188 (implied 
malice). (See discussion of felony-murder 
rule later in this chapter.) 
4. The result of an act done in conscious 
disregard of the consequences, where 
death or serious injury is likely to occur, 
and which indicates an "abandoned and 
malignant heart" such as the tossing of a 
fire bomb into a crowd (implied malice). 
5. The result of an act of resisting a lawful 
arrest and done in a manner that demon­
strates a conscious disregard for human 
life (implied malice). 
9.4 Felony-Murdl~r Rule 
At common law, under the felony-murder 
rule, a murder committed during the perpetration 
of or an attempt to commit a serious felony was 
considered as premeditii\ted murder. In Cailifomia, 
the rule is incorporated into PC 189. Accordingly, 
murders committed during the perpetration of or 
an attempt to commit one of the listed felonies is 
first degree murder. Note: for the felony-murder 
mle to apply, there must be a murder, not merely a 
homicide (People v. Coejield 37 C2 865). 
The effect of the felony-murder rule is that it 
is a substitute for "malice aforethought" in homi­
cides when there is a direct causal connection 
between the commission Olf' attempted commis­
sion of a listed felony and the death (People v. 
Ireland 70 C 2d 522). 
Specific intent required for murder in the first 
degree is still required, but under the felony­
murder rule it is a transferred i.ntent. Accordingly, 
the accused had a specific intent to commit a 
fekny and that intent is transferred to the killing. 
(P:eople v. Dillon 34 C 3d 441). 

-----~.-----------------------------------
88 Chapter 9 
A criminal is accountable for all killings com­
mitted by him/her and his/her associates in the 
course of the felonious conduct. This liability is 
not limited to foreseeable deaths. It also includes 
accidental deaths. For example, in one case the 
accused, intending to commit arson, sets fire to a 
building which he thought was unoccupied. Dur­
ing the fire, a person sleeping in the building was 
killed. The accused was convicted of first degree 
murder under the felony-murder rule (People v. 
Milton 145 C 169). 
The felony-murder rule contained in the penal 
code requires that the "killing" occur in the 
perpetration of one of the listed felonies. A coinci­
dental death is not a "killing" within the meaning 
of the statute (People v. Gunnerson 74 CA 3d 370). 
The death, however, need not be a direct cause of 
the felony. A concurrent cause is sufficient. A 
killing to escape the scene of a felony or to prevent 
discovery or apprehension is a killing within the 
meaning of the felony-murder rule (People v. Rye 
C 2d 688). 
The felony-murder rule does not apply to 
crimes not listed. There is also a corresponding 
misdemeanor-manslaughter rule. Murder com­
mitted during the perpetration of or an attempt to 
commit a felony not Ii sted, or a misdemeanor may 
be second degree murder or manslaughter. 
If two or more persons conspire to commit one 
of the felonies listed in PC 189, and during the 
commission of the felony a murder is committed, 
then each may be tried for the murder as if each 
had conspired to commit the murder. 
In one case, the defendants had conspired to 
take money from a victim. One of the defendants 
struck the victim in the head causing his death. 
The other defendants stated that they had con­
spired to roll a drunk, and that striking the victim 
was not part of the plan. The court instructed the 
jury that the degree of murder depended on 
whether the defendants conspired to rob the vic­
tim (murder in the first degree) or merely "drunk 
rolling" (murder in the second degree) (People v. 
Bauman 39 CA 2d 587). 9.5 Multiplicity 
The general rule is that each victim is consid­
ered a separate crime. Accordingly, if an individ­
ual causes the death of five people by a single 
criminal act, the individual may be tried for five 
murders. In one case, the accused killed two 
people with a single criminal act. The court held 
that the acquittal of the accused in one case did not 
bar prosecution for the other death (People v. 
Carson 37 CA 3d 349). 
9.6 Punishment for Murder 
The punishment for murder is set forth in P C 
190. The punishment schedule is: 
1. Murder in the first degree -death, life

Homicide 89 
9.7 Voluntary Manslaughter 
Voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful kill­
ing of a human being without malice upon a 
sudden quarrel or in the heat of passion. 
Heat of Passion 
To reduce the unlawful killing of a human 
being from murder to manslaughter, the killing 
must be done without malice and as the result of a 
sudden quarrel or done in the heat of passion. 
Sudden quarrel refers to unplanned mutual com­
bat such as a fist fight in a bar caused by a quarrel. 
To constitute adequate "heat of passion," ilie 
accused must be in a state of blinding rage which 
is sufficient to cloud the judgment and common 
sense of a reasonable person and prompts the 
person to act rashly and without deliberation. 
The heat of passion must exist at the time of 
the killing. If the provocation is adequate, but 
there is a cooling off period between the provoca­
tion and the killing, the crime is murder not 
manslaughter. Note: The amount of provocation 
may affect the length of the "cooling off" period. 
9.8 Involuntary Manslaughter 
Involuntary manslaughter is the unlawful and 
unintentional killing of a human being without 
malice during the commission of an unlawful non­
felony act or the commission of a lawful act which 
might produce death, in an unlawful manner and 
without due caution. [Note: P C 192 (b) regarding 
involuntary manslaughter does not apply to deaths 
involving driving a vehicle.] 
There are two basic types of involuntary mllii­
slaughter in California. The first involves the 
unintentional killing of another during the com­
mission of an unlawful act that does not amount to 
a felony. For example, the accused hits the victim 
in the head with his fist without just cause. The 
victim falls and strikes his head on a boulder 
causing his death. The accused has committed 
involuntary manslaughter. Note: if the assault was 
with a dangerous weapon rather than with fists, 
the crime is murder. This is based on the fact that 
assault with a dangerous weapon is a felony 
whereas simple battery is only a misdemeanor. The second type of involuntary manslaughter 
involves those situations where the accidental 
killing results from the commission of a lawful act 
but in a criminally negligent manner. For exam­
ple, taking target practice in a rural area without 
checking out the impact area and thus causing the 
death of a person camping in the vicinity. 
9.9 Vehicular Manslaughter 
Vehicular manslaughter is the unlawful kill­
ing of a human being, without malice and uninten­
tional, while driving a vehicle. 
The types of vehicular manslaughter are: 
1. Death caused by the gross negligence of 
the driver (felony). 
2. Death caused by the negligence, but not 
gross negligence, of the driver 
(misdemeanor). 
3. Death caused by a negligent and unlawful 
act of the driver (felony). 
4. Death caused by the gross negligence of 
the driver while under the influence of 
drugs or alcohol (felony). 
Note: a homicide involving the driving of a 
vehicle is not manslaughter if the death is not the 
pmximate result (cause) of the unlawful act or 
negligence. 
9.10 Gross Negligence 
Gross negligence is defined as: 
1. Such a degree of negligence or careless­
ness that either shows a willful and wanton 
disregard for the life and safety of others, 
2. Amounts to the want of even slight dili­
gence,or 
3. A failure to exercise care of so slight a 
degree as to justify the belief that there is 
an indifference to the safety of others and 
a conscious indifference to the 
consequences. 
9.11 Punishment for Manslaughter· 
The punishment for manslaughter is set forth 
in Penal Code 193. The punishment schedule is: 
1. For voluntary manslaughter --imprison­
ment in the state prison. 
2. For involuntary manslaughter-­
imprisomnent in the state prison. 

90 Chapter 9 
3. For vehicular manslaughter-
a. Involving the commission of an unlaw­
ful act not amounting to a felony and with 
gross negligence or driving a vehicle in the 
commission of a lawful act which might 
produce death, in an unlawful manner and 
with gross negligence-imprisonment in 
the county jail or in state prison. 
b. Same as above except without gross 
negligence- imprisonment in the county 
jail for not more than one year. 
c. D11Ving under the influence of drugs or 
alcohol, but without gross negligence­
imprisonment in the county jailor state 
prison. 
d. Vehicular manslaughter involving 
gross negligence while intoxicated -
imprisonment in the state prison. 
9.12 Suicide 
Suicide is not considered a criminal homicide 
in California. Attempted suicide is, also, not a 
crime in the state. Encouraging another to commit 
suicide is, however, a felony under P C 401. In a 
suicide pact where one party survives, the surviv­
ing party nonnally may be tried for encouraging a 
suicide. Note: this is not the case in murder/ 
suicide situations where the dead party did not 
intend to commit suicide. In thi8latter situation, it 
is probably murder. Also, if the survivor actually 
commits the dea'th causing act on the other person, 
then it is murder even if the act was done at the 
request of the victim. 
9.13 Non-Criminal Homicides 
As stated earlier, not all homicides are crimi­
nal. The non-criminal homicides are classified as: 
1. Excusable 
2. Justifiable 
a. by a police officer 
b. others 
Penal Code 195 Accidental and Excusable 
Homicide 
Homicide is excusable in the following cases: 
1. When committed by accident and misfor­
tune, or in doing any other lawful act by 
lawful means, with usual and ordinary 
caution, and without any unlawful intent. 2. When committed by accident and misfor­
tune, in the heat of passion, upon any 
sudden and sufficient provocation, or 
upon a sudden combat, when no undue 
advantage is taken, nor any dangerous 
weapon is used, and when the killing is not 
done in a cruel or unusual manner. 
Excusable Homicide 
Excusable homicide is a homicide caused by 
an accident or other misfortune while doing a 
lawful act by lawful means and using usual and 
ordinary caution. There must be no unlawful 
intent involved with the act causing the death. For 
example, an automobile accident not involving an 
unlawful act or negligence which causes the death 
of a person, would be excusable homicide (P C 
195). 
9.14 Justifiable Homicide 
Penal Code 199 Acquittal of Person Guilty of 
Justifiable Homicide 
The homicide appearing to be justifiable or 
excusable, the person indicted must, upon his 
trial, be fully acquitted and discharged. 
Justifiable Homicide 
A justifiable homicide is one that was com­
mitted for the protection of society or a part of 
society. A homicide is considered justifiable when 
committed by a public officer as set forth in P C 
196 (above) or in any of the following 
circumstances: 
1. When resisting any attempt by the 
deceased to murder any person, or to 
commit a felony, or to do some great 
bodily injury upon any person. 
2. When committed in defense of home, per­
son or propelty, against one who man­
ifestly intends or endeavors, by violence or 
surprise, to commit a felony. 
3. When committed against one who man­
ifestly intends and endeavors, i.n a violent, 
riotous or tumultuous manner, to enter the 
home of another for the purpose of offer­
ing violence to any person therein. 
4. When reasonably committed in the lawful 
defense of one's self or otl1ers. 

Homicide 91 
5. When necessarily committed in attempt~ 
ing by lawful ways and means to 
apprehend any person for a felony com­
mitted or in lawfully suppressing any riot, 
or in lawfully keeping and preserving the 
peace. 
In the above listed situations, a "bare fear" of 
the commission of a felony is not sufficient to 
justify the homicide. The circumstances must be 
sufficient to excite the fears of a reasonable per­
son, and the party doing the killing must have 
acted under the influence of such fears alone (P C 
198). 
Penal Code 196 Killing in Performance of Offi­
cial Duty Justifiable 
Homicide is justifiable when committed by 
public officers and those acting by their command 
in their aid and assistance, either-
1. In obedience to any judgment of a compe­
tent court; or, 
2. When necessarily committed in overcom­
ing actual resistance to the execution of 
some legal process, or in the discharge of 
any other legal duty; or, 
3. When necessarily committed in retaking 
felons who have been rescued or have 
escaped, or when necessarily committed 
in arresting persons charged with felony, 
and who are fleeing justice or resisting 
arrest. 
Use of Deadly Force By a Police Officer 
In 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court held in 
Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U S 1, that a statute 
which pennitted the police to use deadly force to 
prevent the escape of an unarmed and non-dan­
gerous felon was unconstitutional. This case lim~ 
ited the use of deadly force to only those situations 
where the use is necessary to prevent serious 
bodily harm or death to the police officer or 
others. The Gamer case modifies the provisions of 
P C 196 (in civil liability cases) which indicates 
that homicide is justifiable in overcoming actual 
resistance to the execution of some legal process, 
or in the discharge of any other legal duty. 9.15 Home Protection 
Penal Code 198.5 Home Protection Bill of Rights 
Any person using force intended or likely to 
cause death or great bodily injury within his or her 
residence shall be presumed to have held a reason­
able fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily 
injury to self, family, or a member of the house­
hold when that force is used against another per­
son, not a member of the family or household, 
who unlawfully and forcibly enters or has 
unlawfully and forcibly entered the residence and 
the person using the force knew or had reason to 
believe that an unlawful and forcible entry 
occurred. 
As used in this section, great bodily injury 
means a significant or substantial physical injury. 
9.16 Self-Defense 
The right of self-defense involves the right of 
an individual to repel force with similar force to 
protect his or her life, members of the family, the 
home and other property. Deadly force may be 
used only to prevent great bodily harm, prevent 
the perpetration of a felony by surprise or violence 
against one's person or home. 
Deadly force is not normally justified for the 
protection of property. A person may,however, use 
deadly force to prevent anyone from entering his 
or her home to commit a felony or to inflict serious 
bodily harm on people living in the home. In 
determining whether or not excessive force has 
been used, the courts look to what action appeared 
to be reasonable under the circumstances as they 
appeared to the defender at the time of the attack. 
Instigator 
In most cases, the individual who starts a fight 
cannot rely on self defense to justify the killing. 
An exception to this general rule is where the 
original instigator gives up the fight and attempts 
to retreat. Under these circumstances, the original 
instigator may regain the right to self defense 
(People v. Hoover 107 CA 635). Note: a police 
officer making an arrest is not an instigator (P C 
835a). 
Duty to Retreat 
In some states, a person has a duty to retreat 

92 Chapter 9 
before using deadly force when the individual can 
safely retreat. In California, an individual who is 
attacked may stand his or her ground and defend 
himselforherself(Peoplev.Zuckerman, 56 CA2d 
366).

10.1 Rape 
Penal Code 261 Rape-Acts Constituting 
Rape is an act of sexual intercourse accom­
plished with a person not the spouse of the per­
petrator, under any of the following conditions: 
(1) Where a person is incapable, because 
of mental disorder or developmental 
or physical disability, of giving legal 
consent, and this is known or reason­
ably should be known to the person 
93 committing the act ... the prosecut­
ing attorney shall prove, as an ele­
ment of the crime, that a mental 
disorder or developmental or physi­
cal disability rendered the alleged 
victim incapable of giving consent. 
(2) Where it is accomplished against a 
person)s will by means of force, vio­
lence, or fear of immediate and 
unlawful bodily injury on the person 
or another. 
(3) Where a person is prevented from 
resisting by any intoxicating or anes­
thetic substance, or any controlled 
substance, administered by or with 
the privity of the accused. 
(4) Where a person is at the time uncon­
scious of the nature of the act, and 
this is known to the accused. 
(5) Where a person submits under the 
belief that the person committing the 
act is the victim's spouse, and this 
belief is induced by any artifice, pre­
tense, or concealment practiced by 
the accused, with intent to induce the 
belief. 
(6) Where the act is accomplished 
against the victim's will by threaten­
ing to retaliate in the future against 
the victim or any other person, and 
there is a reasonable possibility that 
the perpetrator will execute the 

94 Chapter 10 
threat. As used in this paragraph 
"threatening to retaliate" means a 
threat to kidnap or falsely imprison, 
or to inflict extreme pain, serious 
bodily injury, or death. 
(7) Where the act is accomplished 
against the victim's will by threaten­
ing to use the authority of a public 
official to incarcerate, arrest, or 
deport the victim or another, and the 
victim has a reasonable belief that the 
perpetrator is a public official. As 
used in this paragraph, "public offi­
cial" means a person employed by a 
governmental agency who has the 
authority, as part of that position, to 
incarcerate, arrest, or deport another. 
The perpetrator does not actually 
have to be a public official. 
Penal Code 261.6 "Consent" Defined 
In prosecutions under Section 261, 286, 288a, 
or 289, in which consent is at issue, "consent" 
shall be defmed to mean positive cooperation in 
act or attitude pursuant to an exercise offree will. 
The person must act freely and voluntarily and 
have know ledge of the nature of the act or transac­
tion involved. 
Penal Code 263 Essential Elements- Penetration 
The essential guilt of rape consists in the 
outrage to the person and feelings of the victim of 
the rape. Any sexual penetration, however, slight, 
is sufficient to complete the crime. 
Elements of Rape 
The elements of rape are: 
1. sexual intercourse with a person not the 
spouse of the perpetrator, and 
2. without the lawful consent of the victim. 
Discussion 
As noted above, to be convicted of rape under 
Section 261, the victim must not be the spouse of 
the perpetrator. (Spousal rape is discussed later in 
this chapter.) In addition, the courts have deter­
mined that to be raped, the victim must be alive at 
the moment of penetration (People v. Stanworth 11 
C 3d 588). A single act of intercourse is only one 
offense of rape, even though it is accomplished under more than one of the circumstances listed in 
PC 261 (People v. Craig 17 C 2d 453). 
Inability by reason of intoxication to form a 
specific intent to rape is not a defense to the crime 
(People v. Potter 77 CA 3d 45). Sterility is, also, 
not a defense (People v. Langdon 192 CA 3d 1419). 
In California, a conviction of rape may be had 
solely on the testimony of the victim. There is no 
requirement for corroboration of the victim's testi­
mony (People v. Frye 117 CA 3d 101). Note: since 
the elements of rape involve sexual intercourse 
with a "person," a woman may be convicted of 
raping a male in California. 
10.2 Sexual Penetration 
Penetration is an essential element of the 
crime of rape (People v. Ray 187 CA 2d 182). 
Sexual intercourse for the purposes of Section 261 
is completed with a sexual penetration, however 
slight (People v. Karsai 131 CA 3d 224). 
10.3 Consent 
Valid consent to the sexual intercourse is a 
defense to the crime of rape (People v. Alfrand 61 
CA 3d 414). A good faith belief by the accused 
that the woman had consented to the sexual inter­
course is a defense to the crime of rape by force or 
fear (People v. Anderson 144 CA 3d 55). 
If a woman initially gives consent, but later 
withdraws her consent, any sexual penetration 
after she withdraws her consent is rape. If consent 
is, however, withdrawn after penetration has 
occurred, that act of intercourse is not rape (Peo­
ple v. Vela 172 CA 3d 237). 
10.4 Rape by Force or Fear 
The crime of forcible rape is committed if at 
any time during the struggle, the accused intends 
to use force or threatens to use force to gratify his 
lustful concupiscence against the victim's will 
(People v. Royal 53 C 62). Actual use of physical 
force is not necessary. Threats of great and imme­
diate bodily harm is sufficient to constitute force. 
The threats, however, must be sufficient to put the 
victim in actual fear of bodily injury (People v. 
Benavidez 255 CA 2d 563). 
The amount of force or threats of force 
required for conviction of forcible rape is that 

Rape and Other Sexual Crimes 95 
amount of physic(ll force required under the cir­
cumstances to overcome the victim's resistance 
(People v. Wheeler 71 CA 3d 902). To convict an 
accused of forcible rape, actual physical resis­
tance on the part of the victim is not required 
(People v. Barnes 42 C 3d 284). The necessary 
threats need not be verbally expressed. Acts, 
conduct or the exhibition of a weapon may imply 
the necessary threats (People v. Benadivez 255 CA 
2d 563). 
An assault with intent to commit rape and 
simple assault are lessor and included offenses of 
rape (People v. Chavez 103 C 407). 
10.5 Gang Rape 
Penal Code 264.1 prohibits conduct when the 
defendant, voluntarily acting in concert with 
another person, by force or violence and against 
the will of the victim, commits rape or anal or 
genital penetration by a foreign object. These acts 
are more commonly known as "gang rape" and is 
a separate crime from the crime of rape. To be 
guilty of this offense, the accused need only aid or 
abet in some manner. He/she does not need to 
personally participate in the act. (People v. Best 
143 CA 3d 232). 
10.6 Unconscious Victim 
To constitute rape under subsection (4) 
(unconscious victim), it is not necessary that the 
victim be totally and physically unconscious. A 
victim is considered as unconscious when the 
victim is unaware of the nature of the act being 
committed on her, and the accused is aware of her 
state (People v. Ogunmola 193 CA 3d 274). In one 
case, a conviction was upheld under PC 261 (4), 
where the victim went to the defendant's office for 
an abortion. During one of the followup visits, the 
defendant had intercourse with her after giving 
her an injection that made her light-headed and 
carefree (People v. Ing 65 C 2d 603). 
In another case prosecuted under subsection 
(4), the conviction was reversed where the accused 
identified himself as a doctor and induced the 
victim to engage in sexual intercourse based on his 
false statement to her that she was suffering from a 
dangerous, highly infectious and fatal disease and 
would die unless she had sexual intercourse with an anonymous donor who had been injected with a 
serum which would cure the disease. The court 
held that based on the above facts, there was no 
rape of a victim who was unconscious a.s to the 
nature of the act, that the woman understood the 
nature of the act, and there was no evidence 
indicating that she lacked the capacity to appreci­
ate the nature of the sex act (Boro v. Superior Court 
163 CA 3d 1224). 
10.7 Consent Obtained by Fraud 
Fraudulent statements or misrepresentations 
which induce sexual intercourse is material only 
for rape under Subsection (5) ofP C 261 (regard­
ing misrepresentation of status as a spouse). Lack 
of the consent of the victim is an essential element 
of rape under Subsections (2) and (3). "Consent" 
even though induced by fraud is still a defense to 
Subsections (2) and (3) (People v. Harris 93 CA 3d 
103). Note: P C 266c (enacted in 1986) makes it a 
crime (unlawful intercourse) to induce sexual 
intercourse by the use of false representation made 
with the intent to create fear. 
A conviction was upheld under Subsection (5) 
where the female, in good faith, entered into a 
"mock marriage" that was arranged by the 
accused. She then engaged in sexual intercourse 
with him on the mistaken belief that she is married 
to him (People v. McCoy 58 CA 534). 
10.8 Statutory Rape 
Penal Code 261.5 Definition of Unlawful Sexual 
Intercourse 
Unlawful sexual intercourse is an act of sexual 
intercourse accomplished with a female not the 
wife of the perpetrator, where the female is under 
the age of 18 years. 
Discussion 
Unlawful intercourse is more popularly 
known as "statutory rape". Consent is not an issue 
in this crime, since sexual intercourse with a 
female under the age of 18 years is prohibited 
(Michael M. v. Superior Court 25 C 3d 608). It is 
not an unconstitutional discrimination to prohibit 
sexual intercourse with a female under 18 years of 
age, but not prohibit similar conduct with a male 
under 18 years of age (People v. Mackey 46 CA 3d 

96 Chapter 10 
755). The defendant's reasonable belief (referred 
to in some cases as a "good faith and reasonable" 
belief) that the victim was over the age of 18 years 
is a defense to "statutory rape." The burden, 
however, to establish this defense is on the defense 
(People v. Zeihm 40 CA 3d 1085 and People v. 
Hernandez 61 C2d 519). Note: the belief as to the 
age of the victim must be not only in good faith, 
but must also be reasonable. 
10.9 Spousal Rape 
Penal Code 262 Rape of Person Who is Spouse 
of Perpetrator 
(a) Rape of a person who is the spouse of a 
perpetrator is an act of unlawful sexual intercourse 
by means of force or fear of immediate and 
unlawfullx>dily injury on the spouse or another, 
or where the act is accomplished against the 
victim's will by threatening to retaliate in the 
future against the victim or any other person, and 
there is a reasonable possibility that the perpetra­
tor will execute the threat. As used in this subdivi­
sion "threatening to retaliate" means a threat to 
kidnap or falsely imprison, or to inflict extreme 
pain, serious bodily injury, or death. 
(b) The provisions of Section 800 shall apply 
to this section; however, there shall be no arrest or 
prosecution under this section unless the violation 
of this section is reported to a peace officer having 
the power to arrest for a violation of this section or 
to the district attorney of the county in which the 
violation occurred, within 90 days after the day of 
the violation. [Note: Section 8eD refers to the six 
year statute of limitations.] 
10.10 Incest 
Penal Code 285 
Persons being within the degrees of con­
sanguinity within which marriages are declared 
by law to be incestuous and void, who intermarry 
with each other, or who commit fornication or 
adultery with each other, are punishable by 
imprisonment in the state prison. 
Evidence Code 621 (a) 
Except as provided in subdivision (b), the 
issue of a wife cohabiting with her husband, who is not impotent or sterile, is conclusively pre­
sumed to be the child of the marriage. [Subdivi­
sion (b) refers to those cases where a blood test 
establishes that the husband cannot be the father 
of the child.] 
Elements of Incest 
The elements of the crime of incest are: 
1. the marriage or sexual intercourse 
between 
2. parties who are related by blood to each 
other by certain degrees of relationship. 
Discussion 
Only marriage and sexual intercourse 
between persons closely related by blood are pro­
hibited under the above penal code. It does not 
prohibit oral copulation. Lack of knowledge of the 
relationship is a defense to incest (People v. Koller 
142 C 621). To be incestuous, there must be a 
blood relationship. Accordingly, where a father 
has sexual intercourse with his adopted daughter, 
while he is guilty of other crimes, he is not guilty 
of incest (People v. Russell 22 CA 3d 330). 
If both parties are over the age of14, and both 
consent to the sexual acts, then both are guilty of 
incest (People v. Pettis 95 CA 2d 790). 
Consanguineous 
Civil Code 4400 lists the following relation­
ships as consanguineous (such close blood rela­
tives as to make marriage and/or intercourse 
illegal): 
1. natural parents, or any degree of grand­
parents and their children, grandchildren, 
etc.; 
2. uncles or aunts and their nieces and 
nephews; and 
3. brothers and sisters and other siblings, 
whether whole-blood or half-blood.

10.11 Penetration by Foreign Object 
Penal Code 289 [Partial] 
(a) Every person who causes the penetration, 
however slight, of the genital or anal opening of 
another person for the purpose of sexual arousal, 
gratification, or abuse by any foreign object, 
substance, instrument, or device when the act is 
accomplished against the victim's will by means 
of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of 
immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the 
victim or another person or where the act is 
accomplished against the victim's will by threat­
ening to retaliate in the future against the victim or 
any other person, and there is a reasonable pos­
sibility that the perpetrator will execute the threat, 
shall be punished by imprisonment in the state 
prison ... 
[Subsections (b) and (c) prohibits such con­
duct on a person incapable of giving consent.] 
[Subsection (d) prohibits similar conduct on 
an unconscious person.] 
[Subsection (e) prohibits such conduct on an 
intoxicated person.] 
[ Subsection (f) prohibits such conduct where 
the person submits under the belief that the person 
committing the act is the spouse of the victim.] 
[Subsection (g) prohibits such conduct where 
consent is obtained by threat to use the authority 
of a public official.] 
[Subsection (h) prohibits such conduct on a 
person under the age of 18.] 
[Subsection (i) prohibits such conduct by a 
person over the age of 21 years against a person 
under the age of 16. Note: this offense has a 
greater maximum punishment than the offense 
under Subsection (h) above.] 
[Subsection G) prohibits such conduct by a 
person under the age of 14 where the offender is 
more than ten years older than the victim. Note: 
this offense has a greater maximum punishment 
than the offenses under Sections (h) and (i).] 
(k) As used in this section, "foreign object, 
substance, instrument, or device" shall include 
any part of the body, except a sexual organ. (1) As used in subsection (a) "threatening to 
retaliate" means a threat to kidnap or falsely 
imprison, or inflict extreme pain, serious bodily 
injury or death. 
Elements of Anal or Genital Penetration 
The elements of the crime of anal or genital 
penetration are: 
1. the intentional anal or genital penetration 
of another 
2. with any object except a "sexual organ," 
3. without the lawful consent of the other 
person. 
Discussion 
In cases where the victim is a child, lack of 
consent is automatically assumed. There is no 
requirement that the accused make the penetration 
for sexually motivated reasons as long as the acts 
are intentionally committed (People v. White 179 
CA 3d 193). 
10.12 Sex Acts-Induced by False Representations 
Penal Code 266c Inducing Commission of Sex­
ual Act Through False Representations Creat­
ing Fear 
Every person who induces any other person, 
except the spouse of the perpetrator, to engage in 
sexual intercourse, penetration of the genital or 
anal openings by a foreign o~ject, substance, 
instrument, or device, oral copulation, or sodomy 
when his or her consent is procured by false or 
fraudulent representation or pretense that is made 
with the intent to create fear, and which does 
induce fear, and that would cause a reasonable 
person in like circumstances to act contrary to the 
person's free will, and does cause the victim to so 
act, is punishable by imprisonment in either the 
county jail ... or in the state prison .... As used 
in this section, "fear" means the fear of unlawful 
physical injury or death to the person or to any 
relative of the person or member of the person's 
family. 
Element of the crime 
The elements of the crime of inducing the 
commission of sexual act through false represen­
tation creating fear are: 

98 Chapter 10 
1. inducing a person, not the spouse of the 
perpetrator 
2. to engage in sexual intercourse or 
3. penetration of the genital or anal openings 
by a foreign object or 
4. oral copulation, or 
5. sodomy 
6. by consent procured by 
7. false or fraudulent representation, or 
8. pretense made with the intent to and actu­
ally creating reasonable fear in the victim 
9. by such conduct that would deprive a 
reasonable person of their free will. 
10.13 Lewd or Dissolute Conduct 
Penal Code 647 [Subsection (a) only.] 
Every person who commits any of the follow­
ing acts is gUilty of disorderly conduct, a 
misdemeanor: 
(a) Who solicits anyone to engage in or who 
engages in lewd or dissolute conduct in any public 
place or in any place open to the public or exposed 
to public view. 
Penal Code 288 Lewd Act on Child Under 14 
[Subsection (a) only.] 
(a) Any person who shall willfully and 
lewdly commit any lewd or lascivious act includ­
ing any of the acts constituting other crimes 
provided for in Part 1 of this code upon, or with the 
body, or any part or member thereof, of a child 
under the age of 14 years, with the intent of 
arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or 
passions or sexual desires of such person or of 
such child, shall be guilty of a felony .... 
Elements of Lewd or Dissolute Conduct (P C 647 
(a» 
The elements of lewd or dissolute conduct 
under Section 647 (a) are: 
1. Soliciting, or engaging 
2. in lewd or dissolute conduct 
3. in any public place, or 
4. in any place open to the public, or 
5. exposed to public view. 
Elements of Lewd Act on Child 
The elements of lewd act on child under 14 
are: 1. a lewd or lascivious act upon any part of 
the body of 
2. a child under the age of 14, 
3. with the specific intent to arouse, appeal 
or to gratify the lust or passions or sexual 
desires of either party. 
Definitions 
Lewd conduct refers to conduct that dis­
regards socially accepted constraints. Lascivious 
refers to wanton, lustful conduct. Dissolute refers 
to conduct that is unashamed, lawless, loose in 
morals and conduct. For example, dancing in the 
nude at a party open to the public was considered 
as "dissolute" conduct (People v. Scott 113 CA 
778) 
Lewd and lascivious act under Section 288 (a) 
has been defined as an act which has a tendency to 
excite lust, committed with a disregard for sexual 
constraints. It is not necessary that the act be 
sexual in nature (People v. Dontanville 172 CA 3d 
783). 
Discussion 
Nude sunbathing on Black's Beach in San 
Diego (a beach where nude sunbathing is popu­
lar), while located in an area open to the public 
was not considered as lewd conduct under Section 
647 (a) (In re Smith 7 C 3d 362). The court in this 
case, stated that nudity of this type is not of itself 
lewd conduct. 
Under Section 288 (a), if the victim is under 
14 years of age, consent is not an element of the 
offense (People v. Dontanville 172 CA 3d 783). 
The offense may be committed by a mere touching 
of the body or clothing of the other person, if done 
with the specific intent to arouse (People v. 
Roberts 26 CA 3d 585). It is also not necessary 
that the naked body be touched (People v. Austin 
111 CA 3d 110). 
10.14 Indecent Exposure 
Penal Code 314 Indecent Exposure 
Every person who willfully and lewdly, 
either: 
1. Exposes his person, or the private parts 
thereof, in any public place, or in any 
place where there are present other per-

Rape and Other Sexual Crimes 99 
sons to be offended or annoyed thereby. or, 
2. Procures, counsels, or assists any other 
persons to expose himself or take part in 
any model artist exhibition, or to make 
any other exhibition of himself to public 
view, or the view of any number of per­
sons, such as is offensive to decency, or is 
adapted to excite to vicious or lewd 
thoughts or acts, is guilty of a misde­
meanor. 
[Last two paragraphs of section dealing with 
punishment are omitted.] 
Elements of the Crime of Indecent Exposure 
The elements of indecent exposure are: 
1. willful exposure of person or private parts 
2. at a place where other persons are present 
who may be annoyed, or 
3. public view 
4. who exposes, procures, counsels, or ass­
ists in the exposure, 
S. and the act is offensive to decency or 
designed to incite vicious or lewd thoughts 
or acts. 
Discussion 
The above elements require willful and lewd 
conduct on the part of the participant. There is, 
however, no requirement for any movement or 
manipulation of the body or parts thereof. A 
person convicted under this section is required to 
register as a sex offender under P C 290. 
10.15 Oral Copulation 
Penal Code 288a Oral Copulation 
(a) Oral copulation is the act of copulating 
the mouth of one person with the sexual organ or 
anus of another person. 
[Subsection (b)(1) prohibits oral copulation 
with another person who is under the age of 18.] 
[Subsection (b)(2) prohibits oral copulation 
by a person over the age of21 with another person 
under the age of 16. This offense has a greater 
maximum punishment than the offense under 
Subsection (b)(1).] 
[Subsection (c) prohibits oral copulation with 
a person under the age of 14 by a person who is ten years older. This offense has a greater maximum 
punishment than the offenses under Subsections 
(b)(1) and (b)(2).] 
[Subsection (d) prohibits oral copulation by 
force or fear.] 
[Subsection (e) prohibits oral copulation by 
any person confined in a state or local confine­
ment facility.] 
[Subsection (f) prohibits oral copulation 
where the other party is unconscious of the nature 
of the act.] 
[Subsections (g) and (h) prohibits oral copula­
tion with a person who is incapable of giving 
lawful consent.] 
[Subsection (i) prohibits oral copulation with 
an intoxicated person.] 
[Subsection U) prohibits oral copulation 
where consent is obtained under the false belief 
that the person committing the act is the spouse of 
the other person.] 
[Subsection (k) prohibits oral copulation 
where consent is obtained under the threat to use 
the authority of a public official.] 
Definition 
Oral copulation is the act of copulating the 
mouth of one person with the sexual organ or anus 
of another person. 
Discussion 
No specific intent, purpose or motive is 
necessary to commit this offense. Oral copulation 
is not illegal if engaged in private by consenting 
persons over the age of18. It is a crime, however, 
if committed by someone confined in a state or 
local confinement facility or on a victim who is 
unconscious, insane or otherwise unable to give 
consent, and this condition is known or should 
have been known by the perpetrator. 
10.16 Sodomy 
Penal Code 286 Sodomy [Partial] 
(a) Sodomy is sexual contact consisting of 
contact between the penis of one person and the 
anus of another person. 

100 Chapter 10 
[Subsections (b) through (Ie) are similar to 
those for oral copulation noted above.] 
Elements of Sodomy 
The elements of sodomy are: 
1. sexual contact by penetration of 
2. the penis of one person, and 
3. the anus of another person 
4. under one of the prohibited situations or 
circumstances. 
Discussion 
No specific intent, purpose or motive is 
required to commit sodomy. Sodomy requires 
"penetration" not merely "contact" (People v. 
Martinez 188 CA 3d 19 and People v. McElrath 
220 CA 4). 
10.17 Sexual Battery 
Penal Code 243.4 Sexual Battery 
(a) Any person who touches an intimate part 
of another person while that person is unlawfully 
restrained by the accused or an accomplice, and if 
the touching is against the will of the person 
touched and is for the purpose of sexual arousal, 
gratification, or abuse, is guilty of sexual battery 
(b) Any person who touches an intimate part 
of another person who is institutionalized for 
medical treatment and who is seriously disabled 
or medically incapacitated, if the touching is 
against the will of the person touched, and if the 
touching is for the purpose of sexual arousal, 
gratification, or abuse, is guilty of sexual battery 
Cc) Any person who, for the purposes of 
sexual arousal, gratification, or abuse, causes 
another, against that person's will while that per­
son is either unlawfully restrained by the accused 
or an accomplice, or is institutionalized formedi­
cal treatment and is seriously disabled or medi­
cally incapacitated, to masturbate or touch an 
intimate part of either of those persons or a third 
person is guilty of sexual battery . . . . 
Cd) As used in this section, "intimate part" 
means the sexual organ, anus, groin, or buttocks 
of any person and the breast of a female .... As 
used in this section, "touches" means physical 
contact with the skin or another person whether accomplished directly or through the clothing of 
the person committing the offense . . . . 
(e) This section shall not be construed to 
limit or prevent prosecution under any other law 
which also proscribes a course of conduct that also 
is proscribed by this section. 
10.18 Sexually Assaulting Animals 
Penal Code 286.5 
Any person who sexually assaults any animal 
protected by Section 597f for the purpose of 
arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of the 
person is guilty of a misdemeanor. 
[Section 597f refers to Animal Neglect and 
protects pets and other domestic animals.] 
Note: any sexual penetration, either penile or 
oral, completes the offense (People v. Smith 117 
CA 2d 648). 
10.19 Registration as Sex Offender 
Penal Code 290 requires persons convicted of 
sex offenses or sex related crimes to register 
within 14 days of coming into any county or city in 
which he or she will reside for any period of time 
with the chief of police or the sheriff of the county.

ll.t Robbery 
Penal Code 211 Defined 
Robbery is the felonious taking of personal 
property in the possession of another, from his 
person or immediate presence, and against his 
will, accomplished by means of forc~ or fear. 
Penal Code 212 Fear Defined 
The fear mentioned in Section 211 may be 
either: 
1. The fear of an unlawful injury to the 
person or property of the person robbed, 
or of any relative of his or member of his 
family; or, 
2. The fear of an immediate and unlawful 
injury to the person or property of anyone 
in the company of the person robbed at the 
time of the robbery. 
Penal Code 212.5 First and Second Degree 
Robbery 
(a) Every robbery of any person who is per­
forming his or her duties as an operator of any (1) 
bus, taxicab, cable car, streetcar, (2) trackless 
trolley, or other vehicle, including a vehicle oper­
ated on stationary rails or on a track or rail 
103 suspended in the air, and used for the transporta­
tion of persons for hire, every robbery of any 
passenger which is perpetrated on any of these 
vehicles, and every robbery which is perpetrated 
in an inhabited dwelling house or trailer coach, as 
defined in the Vehicle Code, or the inhabited 
portion of any other building, is robbery of the 
first degree. 
(b) All kinds of robbery other than those listed 
in subdivision (a), are of the second degree. 
LNote: Section 212.5 was passed in 1986 and 
modified in 1987 by the Legislature to overrule in 
part the decision in People v. Beller 172 CA 3d 
904, which held that robbery and residential robb­
ery were separate substantive crimes. The Legis­
lature indicated that there was only one crime of 
robbery which is set forth in Section 211 and that 
some forms of robbery are more aggravated and 
deserving of greater punishment (Stats. 1986 ch. 
1428, section 6).] 
Definition of Robbery 
. Robbery at common law was the felonious 
taking of personal property in the possession of 
another, from his person or immediate presence, 
and against his will, accomplished by force or fear 
(Black's Law Dictionary 4th ed., page 1492). 
Under the above definition, robbery is an aggra­
vated form of theft with the additional element of 
the taking from the immediate presence and will 
of the victim. In Califomia, robbery is considered 

104 Chapter 11 
as both a crime against the person and the prop­
erty (People v. Jones 53 C 58). Robbery is a 
combination of assault and larceny (People v. Blue 
161 CA 2d 1). 
Elements of Robbery 
The elements of the crime of robbery are: 
1. the wrongful taking of personal property 
(including asportation) 
2. from the possession of another, or 
3. from his or her person, or 
4. from immediate presence 
5. against the will of the person 
6. accomplished by means of force or fear. 
Discussion 
To be robbery, the property taken must have at 
least some intrinsic (real or true) value which is 
subjectto larceny (People v. Stevens 141 C 2d 699). 
One defendant was convicted of robbery based on 
the severance of a standing crop of marijuana 
from property where the other required elements 
were present. The court stated that since the 
severance and taking of a growing crop is now 
subject to larceny, the same property is also sub­
ject to robbery (People v. Dillon 34 C 3d 441). 
Neither the value of the property or the 
amount of money taken is material to the robbery 
offense as long as the property has some value or 
some money was taken (People v. Coleman 8 CA 
3d 722). The fact that the victim from whose 
possession the money was taken was not the true 
owner of the money, is not a defense to the crime 
of robbery. In one case, the victim had earlier 
stolen the money from someone else. The court 
held that even a thief could be robbed (People v. 
Moore 4 CA 3d 668). 
11.2 Immediate Presence or Possession 
The term "immediate presence" is broadly 
interpreted to include any place within sight or 
hearing of the person (People v. Lavender 137 CA 
582). In determining whether or not the property 
is in the immediate presence of the victim, all 
sensory perceptions are used. Actual corporeal 
(physical) presence of the victim is not required 
(People v. Hays 147 CA 3d 534). An attempted 
robbery was, however, not established where no 
person was identified as being present and in possession of a safe that the accused was charged 
with taking (Laurel v. Superior Court 255 CA 2d 
292). 
A robbery was held to have been committed in 
the immediate presence of a victim (an employee), 
even though the employee was not in charge or had 
immediate control of the items stolen (People v. 
Arline 13 CA 3d 200). A security guard or night 
watchman has constructive possession of the mer­
chandise to the same degree as a salesperson 
(People v. Estes 147 CA 3d 23). In one case, the 
employee's mother entered the store during the 
robbery. The accused handed her a bag and 
ordered her to take the money from the cash 
register. A conviction of robbery by taking the 
money from the possession of the mother was 
upheld on appeal (People v. Moore 4 CA 3d 668). 
In one case, the court held that where the 
money was taken from the "immediate posses­
sion" of the victim when the defendant removed 
the victim's pants and allowed her brother to look 
through the pockets while the defendant had sex 
with the victim (People v. Moore 4 CA 3d 668). In 
another case (People v. Davis 100 CA 179), the 
defendant pointed a weapon at the cashier in a 
movie theater. She ran out the back door. He 
entered the ticket booth and took the money. His 
conviction for ro bbery was upheld by the appellate 
court. 
ll.3 Force or Fear 
The property must be taken by either force or 
fear. Unless one or the other is used, the crime is 
not robbery. The particular means, however, by 
which "force" is used or "fear" imposed is not an 
element of robbery (In re Michael 39 C 3d 81). 
Something more, however, than the amount of 
force necessary to lift or seize the property is 
necessary to change the offense from "theft from 
a person" to robbery (People v. Morales 49 CA 3d 
134). The hasty snatching of a purse without 
resistance may be only larceny if no force was 
used nor fear imposed (People v. Church 116 C. 
300). 
The force or fear must have been used for the 
purpose of taking the property, not sQme other 

Robbery and Extortion 105 
reason. Thus, an accused who used force to com­
mit rape and after the rape took a cigarette from 
the victim was not guilty of robbery. This result 
was based on the lack of evidence establishing that 
the victim was afraid to resist the taking and that 
no additional force was used in taking the cigarette 
(People v. Welsh 7 C 2d 209). 
In one case, during the robbery, two victims 
were in joint possession of the property. The court 
stated that since the central element of robbery is 
the force or fear applied to the individual victim, 
two convictions for robbery was appropriate 
where both victims were in joint possession of the 
property (People v. Ramos 30 C 3d 553). 
The degree of fear necessary must be suffi­
cient to cause the victim to comply with the 
unlawful demand for his or her property. It is not 
necessary that terror exists (People v. Borra 123 
CA 482). Fear may be inferred from the circum­
stances surrounding the demand. In one case, the 
victim testified that he did not fear the accused 
even though the accused pointed a weapon at him. 
The court in upholding the robbery conviction 
stated that element of fear could be inferred from 
the fact that a pistol was pointed at the victim 
(People v. Renteria 61 C 2d 497). In another case, 
the conviction for robbery was upheld despite the 
testimony of the victim that she was not afraid of 
the defendant because she did not think he was 
serious when he pointed a weapon at her (People v. 
Harris 65 CA 3d 978). The general rule is that the 
degree of fear needed to establish robbery by 
"fear" is: 
An amount of fear that would cause a 
reasonable person under the same set 
of circumstances to be in fear of his or 
her life, fear or danger of injury or fear 
that his or her property may be injured 
or damaged. 
U.4 Asportation 
The requirement of asportation (movement) is 
similar to the same element required in the theft 
crimes. Only slight movement is required. It is not 
necessary that the property be taken out of the 
physical presence of the victim. As one court 
stated, "Whether the appellant conveyed the money one yard or one mile from the presence of 
the victim is immaterial insofar as the requirement 
of asportation is concerned." (People v. Beal3 CA 
2d 252). In one case, a robbery conviction was 
upheld where the accused was apprehended by 
police officers while leavi.ng the store with the 
money. He never got out of the store (People v. 
LeBlanc 25 CA 3d 576). 
It is not necessary that the accused take actual 
physical possession of the property. The accused 
pointed a weapon at the victim and ordered the 
victim to drop his wallet on the ground. The 
victim did as ordered. When the victim stated that 
there was no money in the wallet, the accused 
ordered him to pick it up and allowed the victim to 
leave. The court held that the acts were sufficient 
to constitute the crime of robbery since all that 
was required was the "taking of possession away 
from the victim and into the control of the taker 
. .. ." (People v. Quinn 77 CA 2d 734). The 
asportation was completed in one case when the 
bank clerk was forced to give the money to 
another bank clerk on orders from the defendant 
(People v. Powell 513 CA 3d 101). 
u.s Intent to Steal 
Robbery is a specific intent crime since an 
intent to steal is an essential element of the crime 
(People v. Ford 60 C 2d 772). The intent to steal 
requirement is the same as that for larceny. 
The necessary intent to steal was missing in 
one case where the money was taken under a good 
faith claim of right to possession of it (People v. 
Sheasbey 82 CA 459). The "good faith" claim of 
right to possession need not be "reasonable." The 
defendant was charged with attempted robbery for 
taking money from a bar that operated an illegal 
gambling game. The defendant stated that he was 
only trying to regain money that he had illegally 
lost in the game. The cour~ said that if the defen­
dant in "good faith" believed that he had a right to 
retake his money, that was a defense to the crime 
of robbery. Note: he was, however, convicted of 
assault (People v. Littleton 25 CA 3d 96). 
It is not the original intent, but the intent at the 
time of taking that determines whether or not the 
crime is robbery. If in the above gambling case, 

106 Chapter 11 
the accused while at first intending to retake only 
his money decides at the time of taking to take 
more than he lost, the crime is robbery. 
In People v. Alvardo (133 CA 3d 1003), a 
robbery conviction was upheld where the evidence 
established that the defendants robbed the victim, 
not to recover property that they had given him in 
exchange for inferior drugs, but to "settle the 
score." Note: the specific intent to steal can b~ 
inferred from the circumstances surrounding the 
taking of the property. 
11.6 Completed Crime of Robbery 
Robbery is completed when the robber has 
taken possession of the propelty and the element 
of asportation is fulfilled. The intervention of the 
police before the property had been taken off the 
premises is immaterial as long as the essential 
elements are satisfied (People v. Johnson 219 CA 
2d 631). 
11.7 Extortion 
Penal Code 518 Defined 
Extortion is the obtaining of property from 
another, with his consent, or the obtaining of an 
official act of a public officer, induced by wrong­
ful use of force or fear, or under the color of 
official right. 
Penal Code 519 Fear Induced by Threat 
Fear, such as will constitute extortion, may be 
induced by a threat, either: 
1. To do an unlawful injury to the person or 
property of the individual threatened or of 
a third person; or, 
2. To accuse the 'individual threatened, or 
any relative of his, at member of his 
family, of any crime; or, "_C 
3. To expose, or to impute to him or them any 
deformity, disgrace or crime; or, 
4. To expose any secret affecting him or 
them. 
Penal Code 521 When Under Color of Office 
Every person who commits any extortion 
under color of official right, in cases for which a 
different punishment is not prescribed in this 
code, is guilty of a misdemeanor. Penal Code 522 Extorting Signature to Transfer 
of Property 
Every person who, by any extortionate 
means, obtains from another his signature to any 
paper or instrument, whereby, if such signature 
were freely given, any property would be trans­
ferred, or any debt, demand, charge, or right of 
action created, is punishable in the same manner 
as if the actual delivery of such debt, demand, 
charge, or right of action were obtained. 
Penal Code 523 Written Threat Made to Extort 
Every person who, with intent to extort any 
money or other property from another, sends or 
delivers to any person any letter or other writing, 
whether subscribed or not, expressing or imply­
ing, or adapted to imply, any threat such as is 
speCified in section 519, is punishable in the same 
manner as if such money or property were actually 
obtained by means of such threat. 
Definition of Extortion 
Common law extortion is defined as taking 
money or other valuable thing either by compul­
sion, by actual force, or by force or motives 
applied to the will and often more overpowering 
and irresistible than physical force (Common­
wealth v. 0' Brien 12 Cush., Mass., 90). Extortion 
is popularly known as "blackmail." Both extor­
tion and robbery are aggravated forms of theft. 
Extortion, however, is broader than robbery in the 
following ways: 
1. Extortion does not require a taking of the 
property from the presence or possession 
of the victim. 
2. Extortion does not require that the threat 
be of immediate harm as in robbery. 
3. The types of harms that constitute extor­
tion are much broader than those covered 
in the robbery statute. 
4. Robbery pertains only to personal prop­
erty, whereas extortion can involve real 
property. 
5. With extortion, the victim "consents" to 
the turning over of the property or money. 
Elements of Extortion 
The elements of the crime of extortion are: 
1. The act of obtaining property or money 
from another, 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robbery and Extortion 107 
2. with the consent of the other, or 
3. obtaining an official act of a public officer, 
4. by inducement through wrongful use of 
force, or 
5. fear, or 
6. under color of official right. 
Discussion 
Extortion may be committed for the purposes 
of obtaining "property" or "an official act of a 
public officer." The "property" requirement is 
broadly interpreted. A threat to expose the victim 
unless the victim withdrew an appeal in a pending 
civil law suit was considered "property" in one 
case (People v. Cadman 57 C 562). Extortion is a 
crime that involves moral turpitude (In re Coffey 
123 C 522). To be exturtion, the threat must imply 
or express one of the statutory threats listed in 
Section 519 (People v. Choynski 95 C 640). 
Threats Inducing Fear 
The threats inducing fear may be: 
1. threat to injure person or property, 
2. to accuse one of a crime, 
3. to defame or expose, or 
4. to expose a secret. 
The "fear" must be the controlling factor in 
consenting to the turning over of the property or 
doing an official act. As one court stated' 'the fear 
must be so material that the money would not have 
been paid without it" (People v. Turner 22 CA 2d 
186). No precise words need be used. "Anexperi­
enced extortionist does not find it necessary to 
designate specifically what he intends to do as a 
means of terrifying his prey" (People v. 
Oppenheimer 209 CA 2d 413). The use of high­
pressure on an elder homeowner by a belligerent 
and aggressive male which forced the homeowner 
to agree to unwanted work at an exorbitant sum 
was determined to be extortion by one court 
(People v. Massengale 10 CA 3d 689). 
The "threat to accuse one of a crime" is 
extortion (if other elements are present) even if the 
person is in fact guilty of the crime. It makes no 
difference as to the motives of the person making 
the threat. Accordingly, a "just" motive for mak­
ing the threat is normally not a defense to extor­
tion. For example, it is extortion for a person from whom property was stolen to threaten the thief 
with prosecution unless the thief pays for the 
property (People v. Beggs 178 C. 79). 
The threat "to defame or expose another" 
must be of a nature that tends to impute deformity, 
disgrace or a crime. A threat to make public 
certain matters contained in court proceedings 
which would tend to ruin the character and busi­
ness of the person threatened was an adequate 
basis for an extortion conviction (People v. Cad­
man 57 C 562). 
The threat to expose a secret must be such that 
it is unfavorable to the reputation of the person 
exposed or defamed. The secret normally must be 
unknown to the general public, or some particular 
part thereof, which others might be interested in 
obtaining. The damage of the exposure must be 
such that it would likely induce a person through 
fear to payout money or give up property for the 
purpose of avoiding the exposure (People v. Lavine 
115 CA 289). 
~~H;.i1ding Threatening Letters 
The offense of sending threatening letters 
does not require that the threat be apparent on the 
face of the writing. The prosecution may produce 
evidence of the facts surrounding the writings to 
establish the nature of the threat. It is enough if the 
writings used language that imply any of the 
threats specified in Section 519. This offense is 
completed at the time that the letter is deposited in 
the mail or the writing is delivered. The offense is 
punishable in the same manner as if the property 
was actually obtained (People v. Choynski 95 C 
640). Extortion is not committed by a creditor 
sending a letter to a debtor threatening to take legal 
action if a debt is not paid (Murray Showcase & 
Fixture Co. v. Sullivan 15 CA 475). 
Obtaining Signature by Threat 
This section provides that any transfers of 
property or right of action transferred under threat 
of extortion is void. In addition, the act is punish­
able as extortion, i.e., as if the actual delivery of 
the propCIty or right of action was obtained (Peo­
ple v. Peppercorn 34 CA 2d 603). This crime is 
complete when a signature is obtained (People v. 
Massengale 10 CA 3d 689). Note: the obtaining of 

108 Chapter 11 
a written confession regarding a crime is not a 
violation of this offense, since a confession is 
neither property nor an instrument that creates a 
right of action (People v. Kohn 258 CA 2d 368). 
11.8 Simulating Court Process 
Penal Code 526 Imitation or Pretended Process 
-Delivery 
Any person who, with the intent to obtain 
from another person any money, article or per­
sonal property, or other thing of value, (1) delivers 
or causes to be delivered to (2) the other person 
any paper, document or written, typed or printed 
fonn purporting to be an order or other process of 
a court, designed or calculated by its writing, 
typing or printing, or the arrangement thereof, to 
cause or to lead (3) the other person to believe it to 
be an order or other process of a court, when in 
fact such paper, document or writing is not an 
order or process of a court, is guilty of a misde­
meanor, and each separate delivery ... constitutes 
a separate offense. 
Discussion 
It is a crime under this section for a debt 
collector, creditor or attorney to send a document 
to a debtor which simulates a legal or judicial 
process or gives the appearance of authorization 
by governmental agency for the purposes of col­
lecting a debt. 
CLASSROOM DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 
1. The owner of a store put a bag of money down 
beside his car and went back into his store to 
get the keys to the car. When the owner 
returned, he encountered the defendant who 
had the money in one hand and a gun in the 
other. The defendant ordered the store owner 
to move away and got into a car and left. Do 
the above facts support the offense of robbery 
or only theft? (Note: facts taken from the case 
of People v. Perhah 92 CA 2d 430). 
2. The defendants forced a bank manager at 
gunpoint to take money from the vault. The 
manager then carried the money to the rear of 
the bank in order to give it to the defendants. 
The defendants were apprehended before 
receiving the money from the manager. Has the crime of robbery been completed? (Note: 
facts taken from the case of People v. Price 25 
CA 3d 576). 
3. What degree of force is necessary to con-
stitute robbery by force? 
4. Define' 'asportation." 
5. Is robbery a specific intent crime? 
6. What are the differences between robbery 
and extortion? 
7. Define' 'immediate presence" for purposes of 
the robbery statutes.

12.1 Kidnapping 
Penal Code 207 Definition of Kidnapping 
(a) Every person who forcibly steals, takes, 
109 or arrests any person in this state, and carries the 
person into another country, state, or county, or 
into another part of the same county, is guilty of 
kidnapping. 
(b) Every person, who for the purposes of 
committing any act defined in Section 288, hires, 
persuades, entices, decoys, or seduces by false 
promises, misrepresentations, or the like, any 
child under the age of 14 to go out of this country, 
state, or county, or into another part of the same 
county, is guilty oflddnapping. 
(c) Every person who forcibly takes or arrests 
any person, with a design to ta."'<e the person out of 
this state, without having established a claim, 
according to the laws of the United States, or of 
this state, or to be taken or removed therefrom, for 
the purpose and with the intent to sell such person 
into slavery or involuntary servitude, or otherwise 
to employ such person for his or her own use, or to 
the use of another, without the free will and 
consent of such persuaded person, is guilty of 
kidnapping. 
(d) Every person, who being out of the state, 
abducts or takes by force or fraud any person 
contrary to the laws of the place where such act is 
committed, and brings, sends, or conveys such 
person within the limits of this state, and is 
afterwards found within the limits thereof, is 
guilty of kidnapping. 
Kidnapping Defmed 
At common law, kidnapping involved the 

110 Chapter 12 
forcible asportation (carrying away) of a person 
from their own county to another (Dix and 
Sharlot, Basic Criminal Law). In California, the 
statutory crime of kidnapping requires only the 
movement of a person from one part of county to 
another part. Accordingly, kidnapping by force is 
the unlawful, forcible taking of a person against 
his or her will from one place to another. 
Elements of Kidnapping 
Under Penal Code 207 (above), there are four 
different crimes of kidnapping in California. The 
elements of each are set forth below: 
1. Forcible Kidnapping [P C 207(a)] 
elements: 
a. the unlawful movement by force 
b. of a person by another 
c. against the person's will 
d. from one place to another 
2. Kidnap with Intent to Commit P C 288 
felony (crimes against children, lewd and 
lascivious acts) [P C 207(b)] elements: 
a. hiring, persuading, decoying, entic­
ing, seducing, by false promises, mis­
representations, or the like of 
b. a child under the age of 14 years 
c. to go from one place to another 
d. with the intent to commit a violation of 
P C 288 [crimes against children, lewd 
and lascivious acts] 
3. Kidnapping with Intent to Take Out of 
State [P C 207(c)] elements: 
a. a forcible taking or arresting of another 
b. with the specific intent to remove the 
person from the state 
c. without legal authority 
4. Bringing IGdnapped Victim into State [p 
C 207(d)] elements: 
a. the unlawful abduction or taking of a 
victim in another state 
b. bringing the victim into this state 
Discussion 
The movement required to constitute the 
offense of kidnapping must be unlawful. Move­
ment is not unlawful if accomplished pursuant to a 
legal arrest or with the valid consent of the victim. 
The term "unlawful" means only that the victim has not given consent and the movement is not 
pursuant to a valid legal order or court process. 
Force 
The force required to constitute the offense is 
sufficient as long as the victim feels compelled to 
obey, and reasonably fears some kind of harm will 
occur if the force is used. Note: no physical force 
or express threats are needed to effectuate the 
movement (Peoplev. Caudillo 21 C3rd 562). If the 
kidnapping starts in a vehicle, the fact that the 
initial consent to enter the vehicle was given by 
the victim is immaterial as long as the victim is 
subsequently restrained during movement of the 
automobile (People v. Galvin 187 CA 3d 1205). 
If the victim consents to the movement, even 
if the consent was obtained by fraud, the crime is 
not kidnapping under P C 207 (a), (c) and (d), 
Only movements accomplished by force are mate­
rial to the offense of forcible kidnapping under PC 
207. (People v. Stephenson 10 C 3rd 652). 
Movement 
The statute does not define the distance 
required to constitute the offense of kidnapping. 
The courts have had difficulty with this element. 
This difficulty is caused by the common law 
requirement that the victim be taken to another 
county. P C 207 requires only that the movement 
be to "another part of the county." Based on this 
phrase, the courts have required that the "move­
ment" necessary to complete the offense of kid­
napping must be substantial as opposed to slight 
or trivial. 
Substantial movement was defined by one 
court as the movement that subjects the victim to a 
substantial increase in the risk of harm. A move­
ment of one city block was considered sufficient, 
whereas the movement of the victim across a room 
or from a vehicle to a storefront was not (People v. 
Maxwell 94 CA 3d 562). Forcing a victim at 
gunpoint to walk: one-quarter mile was considered 
as substantial movement (People v. Stanworth 11 C 
3rd 601). Dragging a victim from the front of a 
laundromat to the rear to sexually assault her was 
insufficient movement to constitute kidnapping 
(People v. Thornton 11 C 3rd 738). Note; if all the 

------~---------------------------------------------------
Kidnapping, False Imprisonment and Laws of Arrest 111 
elements are present except substantial move­
ment, then the offense may be an "attempted 
kidnapping. " 
A two-prong test is used to establish forcible 
kidnapping (People v. Caudillo 21 C 3d 562): 
1. Was the movement by compulsion? 
2. Was the movement substantial? 
Intent to Take Victim Out of State 
The offense of kidnapping with the intent to 
take the victim out of the state (p C 207(c» is 
designed, in part, to prevent law enforcement 
officers from unlawfully taking suspects out of the 
state to avoid extradition laws. For example, if the 
police from another state locate a person wanted in 
that state living in California, they cannot cross 
state lines and take the person by force out of 
California without going through the required 
legal process. 
12.2 False Imprisonment 
Penal Code 236 False Imprisonment Defined 
False imprisonment is the unlawful violation 
of the personal liberty of another. 
Elements of False Imprisonment 
The elements of false imprisonment are: 
1. the unlawful violation 
2. of the personal liberty of another 
Discussion 
False imprisonment is always a lessor and 
included offense of the offense of kidnapping 
(People v. Maxwell 94 CA 3d 562). False 
imprisonment is a misdemeanor unless it is com­
mitted by; violence, menace, fraud or deceit. Ifso 
committed, it is a felony (p C 237). 
False imprisonment, unlike forcible kidnap­
ping, is not considered an "inherently dangerous 
felony" by the courts. Accordingly, the felony­
murder rule does not apply (People v. Henderson 
19 C 3d 86). 
12.3 Posing as Kidnapper 
Penal Code 210 Posing as Kidnapper 
Every person who for the purposes of 
obtaining any ransom or reward, or to extort or 
exact from any person, any money or thing of value, poses as, or in any manner represents 
himself to be a person who has seized, confined, 
kidnapped or carried away any person, or who 
poses as, or in any manner represents himself to be 
a person who holds or detains such person, or who 
poses as, or in any manner represents himself to be 
the person who has aided or abetted any such act, 
or who poses as or in any manner represents 
himself to be the person who has the influence, 
power, or ability, to obtain the release of such 
person so seized or concealed, kidnapped or car­
ried away, is guilty of a felony .... 
Nothing in this section prohibits any person 
who in good faith believes that he can rescue any 
person who has been seized, confined, inveigled, 
enticed, decoyed, abducted, concealed, kid­
napped or carried away, and who has had no part 
in, or connection with, such confinement, inveig­
ling, decoying, false abducting, concealing, kid­
napping, or carrying away, from offering to rescue 
or obtain the release of such person monetary 
consideration or other thing of value. 
12.4 Kidnapping for Purposes of Commit­
ting Sexual Offense 
Penal Code 667.8 provides for a sentence 
enhancement if convicted of kidnapping for the 
purposes of committing sexual offense. 
12.5 Kidnapping Child Under 14 
Penal Code 667.85 Prison Term for Kidnapping 
Child Under 14 Years 
Any person convicted of a violation of Section 
207, who kidnapped or carried away any child 
under the age of 14 years with the intent to 
permanently deprive the parent or legal guardian 
custody of that child, shall be punished by an 
additional term of five years. 
12.6 Kidnapping for Ransom, Extortion or 
Robbery 
Penal Code 209 Kidnapping for Ransom or 
Extortion 
(a) Any person who seizes, confines, invei­
gles, entices, decoys, abducts, conceals, kidnaps 
or carries away any individual by any means 
whatsoever with intent to hold or detain, or who 
holds or detains, such individual for ransom, 

112 Chapter 12 
reward or to commit extortion or to exact from 
another person who aids or abets any such act, is 
guilty of a felony and upon conviction thereof 
shall be punished . .. . 
(b) Any person who kidnaps or carries away 
any individual to commit robbery shall be 
punished by imprisonment in the state prison for 
life with the possibility of parole. 
Discussion 
Unlike forcible kidnapping (which is a general 
intent crime), kidnapping for ransom, reward, or 
extortion is a specific intent crime. To be an 
offense under this section, at the time of the 
kidnapping, the offender must commit the offense 
with the specific intent to either rob, extort or 
obtain a ransom or reward. 
To be guilty of kidnapping for the purposes of 
robbery, there must be substantial movement sim­
ilar to that required for forcible kidnapping under 
PC 207. The movement need not, however, be 
related to the same victim as the robbery is as long 
as the kidnapping was accomplished for the pur­
poses of robbery. For example, if the accused robs 
a storeowner, then kidnaps a customer in order to 
assist in his escape; he is guilty of kidnapping for 
the purposes of committing robbery. 
The offense oflddnapping for the purposes of 
ransom or extortion, unlike forcible robbery, does 
not require any movement. Mere holding the 
person with the specific intent to obtain payment 
of a ransom or reward or to commit extortion is 
sufficient to constitute the offense. 
Bodily Harm 
Under P C 209, the offender is subject to 
greater punishment if the victim suffers "bodily 
harm." "Bodily halm" for the purposes of this 
punishment enhancement exists whenever the vic­
tim suffers some degree of bodily trauma. It does 
not need to be serious injury. A cut requiring 
stitches or a rape is sufficient to constitute' 'bodily 
harm." A mere nose bleed is not (People v. 
Schoen field 111 CA 3d 671). The harm required to 
constitute "bodily harm" is less than "great 
bodily harm" required in other penal code provi­
sions (People v. Caudillo 21 C 3d 562). 12.7 Child Abduction 
Penal Code 277 Punishment for Taking Minor 
From Person or Public Agency 
In the absence of a court order determining 
rights of custody or visitation to a minor child, 
every person having a right of custody of the child 
who maliciously takes, detains, conceals, or 
entices away that child within or without the state, 
without good cause, and with the intent to deprive 
the custody right of another person or a public 
agency also having a custody right to that child 
shall be punished by imprisonment in the county 
jail ... or by imprisonment in state prison .... 
A subsequently obtained court order for 
custody or visitation shall not affect the applica­
tion of this section. 
For purposes of this section, "a person having 
a right of custody" means the legal guardian of the 
child or a person who has a parent and child 
relationship with the child pursuant to Section 197 
of the Civil Code. 
Penal Code 278 Taking Minor From Parent or 
Guardian 
Every person, not having a right of custody, 
who maliciously takes, detains, conceals, or 
entices away, any minor child with intent to detain 
or conceal that child from a person, guardian, or 
public agency having the lawful charge of the 
child shall be punished by imprisonment in the 
state prison ... or ... in a county jail. 
Penal Code 278.5 Concealment, Detention, 
Taking or Retaining of Child in Violation of 
Custody Order 
(a) Every person, who in violation of the 
physical custody or visitation provisions of a 
custody order, judgment, or decree, takes, 
detains, conceals, or retains the child with the 
intent to deprive another person of his or her rights 
to physical custody or visitation shall be punished 
by imprisonment in the state prison ... or ... in 
county jail .. , . 
(b) Every person who has a right to physical 
custody of or visitation with a child pursuant to an 
order, judgment, or decree of any court which 
grants another person, guardian, or public agency 
right to physical custody of or visitation with that 
child, and who within or without the state detains, 

Kidnapping. False Imprisonment and Laws of Arrest 113 
conceals, takes, or entices away that child with the 
intent to deprive the other person of that right to 
custody or visitation shall be punished by 
imprisonment in the state prison .... or ... .in the 
county jail .... 
Penal Code 279 Concealment or Detention of 
Child in Violation of Custody Order •... 
(a) A peace officer investigating a report of a 
violation of Section 277,278, or 278.5 may take a 
minor child into protective custody if it reasonably 
appears to the officer that any person unlawfully 
will. flee the jurisdictional territory with the minor 
child. 
(b) A child who has been detained or con­
cealed shall be returned to the person, guardian, 
or public agency having lawful charge of the child, 
or to the court in which a custody proceeding is 
pending, or to the probation department of the 
juvenile court in the county in which the victim 
resides. 
(c) The offenses enumerated in Sections 277, 
278, and 278.5 are continuous in nature, and 
continue for so long as the minor child is con­
cealed or detained. 
(d) Any expenses incurred in returning the 
child shall be reimbursed as provided in Section 
4605 of the Civil Code. Those expenses, and costs 
reasonably incurred by the victim, shall be 
assessed against any defendant convicted of a 
violation of Section 277,278 or 278.5. 
(e) Pursuant to Sections 27 and 778, violation 
of Section 277, 278 or 278.5 is punishable in 
California, whether the intent to commit the 
offense is formed within or without the state, if the 
child was a resident of California or present in 
California at the time of the taking, or if the child 
thereafter is found in California. 
Discussion 
In kidnapping, the victim is forced to go with 
the offender. Child stealing, however, is a crime 
against the person with the right to custody, and 
therefore, the consent of the child is irrelevant. 
Sections 277, 278 and 278.5 makes it a crime 
to maliciously take, detain, conceal or entice a 
child away from the person or agency who has the 
legal right to custody. The right to lawful custody 
in the other person or agency may exist as the result of a court order or the "natural" right of a 
parent. It is also a crime under the above sections 
if the person taking the child has some right to 
custody, but violates the visitation periods or 
rights (terms) of the custody order, judgment or 
decree. For example, in one case the father was 
convicted of a violation of Section 278.5 (felony) 
even though he had custody 50 percent of the time. 
In this case, the father took the child and moved to 
another state where he concealed the location of 
the child from the child's mother (People v. Lortz 
137 CA 3d 363). 
If the taking is for "good cause, " there is no 
violation of the above sections. "Good cause" for 
the purposes of these sections is defined as a 
"good faith belief' that the taking, detaining, 
concealing, or enticing away of the child is neces­
sary to protect the child from immediate bodily 
injury or emotional harm. In some situations, a 
person may be convicted under Section 277 as a 
substitute for attempted child molestation charges. 
For example, if the offender entices the child to 
another location for the purposes of sexual molest­
ing, but does not complete the offense of child 
molesting, the movement of the child by the 
enticement of the offender may constitute a viola­
tion of Section 277. 
12.8 Laws of Arrest 
Penal Code 834 Who May Make and Acts 
Constituting 
An arrest is taking a person into custody, in a 
case and in the manner authorized by law. An 
arrest may be made by a peace-officer or by a 
private person. 
Penal Code 834a Duty to Refrain From Resist­
ing Arrest 
If a person has knowledge, or by the exercise 
of reasonable care, should have knowledge, that 
he is being arrested by a peace officer, it is the 
duty of such person to refrain from using force or 
any weapon to resist such arrest. 
Penal Code 835 Restraint limited to Necessity 
An arrest is made by an actual restraint of the 
person, or by submission to the custody of an 
officer. The person arrested may be subjected to 

114 Chapter 12 
such restraint as is reasonable for his arrest and 
detention. 
Penal Code 835a Use of Reasonable Force to 
Effect Arrest 
Any peace officer who has reasonable cause 
to believe that the person to be arrested has 
committed a public offense may use reasonable 
force to effect the arrest, to prevent the escape or 
to overcome resistance. 
A peace officer who makes or attempts to 
make an arrest need not retreat or desist from his 
efforts by reason of the resistance or threatened 
resistance of the person being arrested; nor shall 
such officer be deemed an aggressor or lose his 
right to self-defense by the use of reasonable force 
to effect the arrest or to prevent escape or to 
overcome resistance. 
Penal Code 836 Arrest Under Warrant-Peace 
Officer 
A peace officer may make an arrest in obe­
dience to a warrant, or may, pursuant to the 
authority granted to him by the Provisions of 
Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 830) of 
Title 3 of Part 2, without a warrant, arrest a 
person: 
1. Whenever he has reasonable cause to 
believe that the person to be arrested has 
committed a public offense in his 
presence. 
2. When a person arrested has committed a 
felony, although not in his presence. 
3. Whenever he has reasonable cause to 
believe that the person to be arrested has 
committed a felony, whether or not a fel­
ony has in fact been committed. 
Penal Code 837 Arrest by Private Person 
A private person may arrest another: 
1. For a public offense committed or 
attempted in his presence. 
2. When the person arrested has committed a 
felony, although not in his presence. 
3. When a felony has been in fact committed, 
and he has reasonable cause for believing 
the person arrested to have committed it. 
Penal Code 838 Arrest for Acts in Presence of 
Magistrate 
A magistrate may orally order a peace-officer or private person to arrest anyone committing or 
attempting to commit a public offense in the 
presence of such magistrate. 
Penal Code 839 Summoning Assistance 
Any person making an arrest may orally sum­
mon as many persons as he deems necessary to aid 
him therein. 
Penal Code 840 Time of Day Arrest May be 
Made 
An arrest for the commission of a felony may 
be made on any day and at any time of the day or 
night. An arrest for the commission of a misde­
meanor or an infraction cannot be made between 
the hours of 10 o'clock p.m. of any day and 6 
o'clock a.IIi. of the succeeding day, unless: 
(1) The arrest is made without a warrant 
pursuant to Section 836 or 837. 
(2) The arrest is made in a public place. 
(3) The arrest is made when the person is in 
custody pursuant to another lawful arrest. 
(4) The arrest is made pursuant to a warrant 
which, for good cause shown, directs that it may 
be served at any time of the day or night. 
Penal Code 841 Notice of Authority and Intent 
to Arrest 
The person making the arrest must inform the 
person to be arrested of the intention to arrest him, 
of the cause of the arrest, and the authority to 
make it, except when the person making the arrest 
has reasonable cause to believe that the person to 
be arrested is actually engaged in the commission 
of or an attempt to commit an offense, or the 
person to be arrested is pursued immediately after 
its commission, or after an escape. 
The person making the arrest must, on request 
of the person he is arresting, inform the latter of 
the offense for which he is being arrested. 
Penal Code 842 Showing Warrant on Demand 
An arrest by a peace officer acting under a 
warrant is lawful even though the officer does not 
have the warrant in his possession at the time of 
the arrest, but if the person arrested so requests it, 
the warrant shall be shown to him as soon as 
practicable. 

Kidnapping, False Imprisonment and Laws of Arrest 115 
Penal Code 843 Overcoming Resistance of Pre­
venting Escape 
When the arrest is being made by an officer 
under the authority of a warrant, after infonnation 
of the intention to make the arrest, if the person to 
be arrested either fleas or forcibly resists, the 
officer may use all necessary means to effect the 
arrest. 
Discussion 
The above Penal Code provisions regarding 
the "laws of arrest" are generally self-explana­
tory. Some of the key concepts, however, are 
restated below: 
1. Nonnally, a peace officer may arrest with­
out a warrant for misdemeanor only when 
he or she has probable cause to believe that 
the suspect committed the crime in the 
presence of the peace officer. 
2. A private person may arrest only when a 
crime has been committed or attempted. A 
peace officer may arrest when he or she 
has probable cause to believe that an 
offense has been committed. 
3. A person has a duty to refrain from resist­
ing an arrest by a peace officer. It is not a 
defense that the peace officer had no 
authority to arrest (p C 834a). 
Additional Arrest Provisions 
Listed below are some additional arrest provi­
sions that pertain to the "laws of arrest:" 
1. A juvenile may be arrested without a war­
rant for a misdemeanor even if it was not 
committed in the peace officer's presence 
(Welfare and Institutions Code, Section 
625). 
2. A peace officer may arrest without a war­
rant a person who has committed an 
a:ssault or battery on school property dur­
ing school hours (even though it was not 
committed in the presence of the peace 
officer) ( P C 243.5). 
3. As a general rule, a person may not be 
arrested inside a dwelling unless there is 
an arrest warrant, consent to enter the 
dwelling is given, or emergency circum­
stances (exigent circumstances) exist (Payton v. U.S. 445 U.S. 573). An example 
of exigent circumstances is an arrest made 
in a dwelling without a warrant if there is 
probable cause to believe that the suspect 
inside is anned and is likely to use the 
weapon (James v. Superior Court 87 CA 3d 
985). 
4. Refusing to aid and assist a unifonned 
peace officer in making an arrest is a 
misdemeanor (p C 150). 
5. Forcible freeing of a prisoner from the 
lawful custody of the arresting party is a 
felony (p C 4550). 
6. While a peace officer may use a reason­
able amount of force to make an arrest, 
deadly force may only be llsed in the 
protection of life (Peterson v. City of Long 
Beach 24 C 3d 238).

13.1 Historical and Constitutional 
Developments 
U.S. Constitution, Amendment I (adopted 1791) 
Congress shall make no law respecting an 
establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free 
exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of 
speech, or of the press. " . 
Discussion 
Historically, obscenity and similar laws invol­
ving public decency and morality have had prob­
lems with three constitutional principles: 
1. the freedom of speech under the First 
Amendment, 
2. the void for vagueness doctrine (Winters v. 
New York 333 U.S. 507), and 
3. the constitutional right of privacy (Stanley 
v. Georgia 394 U.S. 557). 
Free Speech 
Often the defense of "free speech" is raised 
when dealing with obscene matters. In Roth v. 
United States (354 U.S. 476) decided by the U.S. 
Supreme Court in 1957, the Court held that 
obscenity was not protected by the First Amend­
ment. The present standard for determining what 
constitutes obscenity is based on the 1973 U.S. 
Supreme Court case of Miller v. California (413 
U.S. 15). Those standards are reflected in the 
obscenity statutes listed later in this chapter. 

118 Chapter 13 
Vagueness 
As Justice Reed stated in Winters v. New York 
(333 U.S. 507): "It is settled that a statute so vague 
and indefmite, in fOIm and as interpreted, as to 
peImit within the scope of its language the punish­
ments of incidents fairly within the protection of 
the guarantee of free speech is void on its face." 
Mr. Justice Reed, also, noted the difficulty of 
defining crimes by words well understood 
through long use in the criminal law (i.e. obscene, 
lewd, lascivious, filthy, indecent or disgusting) 
leaves a person uncertain as to the kind of pro­
hibited conduct covered by the statute. 
To overcome the above objections, the stat­
utes involving obscenity and similar conduct are 
required to be as precise as practical. For this 
reason, these statutes are very lengthy and may 
appear to be unnecessarily repetitious. 
Privacy 
The Supreme Court in Stanley v. Georgia (394 
U.S. 557) stated: "Whatever may be the justifica­
tions for other statutes regulating obscenity, we do 
not think they reach into the privacy of one's own 
home. If the first amendment means anything, it 
means a State has no business telling a man, 
sitting alone in his own home, what books he may 
read or what f!.lms he may watch" This right of 
privacy, however, does not protect the public 
exhibition of obscene matter nor the involvement 
of minors (Paris Adult Theatre v. Slaton 413 U.S. 
49). 
13.2 Community Standards 
The test of obscenity is its violation of "con­
temporary standards." The prosecution has the 
burden of proving what the standards are and that 
the matter violates those standards. Since there are 
different standards in different parts of the coun­
try, this creates a problem in deteImining which 
standards apply. The obscenity standards for 
Fresno, California are quite different from the 
obscenity standards for New York City. Two 
approaches that have historically been used are 
the "local community standards" and the 
"national standards." California, however, as the 
result of a 1988 amendment to the Penal Code, now uses the "local community standards" ap­
proach in this area. 
13.3 District Attorney's Charging 
Considerations 
Traditionally, district attorneys have had 
major practical problems in deteImining whether 
or not to charge and prosecute obscenity and 
similar types of crimes. Those problems include: 
1. Obscenity and decency cases are difficult 
and expensive to prosecute. Each case will 
take a considerable portion of a DA's lim­
ited resources. 
2. Prosecution has, in the past, had minimal 
effect in reducing the availability of 
obscene matter or little effect on stopping 
prostitution in the community. 
3. Public feeling regarding obscenity and 
similar cases are nOImally very strong 
toward prosecution. 
As indicated by the above problems, the dis­
trict attorney normally has a difficult and unpopu­
lar choice involved in making the decision to 
prosecute or not to prosecute. 
13.4 Obscenity 
Penal Code 311 Definitions 
(a) "Obscene matter" means matter taken as 
a whole, the predominant appeal of which to the 
average person, applying contemporary community 
standards, is to prurient interest, meaning a 
shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or 
excretion; and is matter which taken as a whole 
goes beyond customary limits of candor in 
description or representation of such matters; and 
is matter which taken as a whole lacks significant 
literacy, artistic, political, educational, or scien­
tific value. 
(1) The predominant appeal to prurient inter­
est of the matter is judged with reference to 
average adults unless it appears from the nature of 
the matter or the circumstances of its dissemina­
tion, distribution or exhibition, that it is designed 
for clearly defmed deviant sexual groups, in which 
case the predominant appeal of the matter shall be 
judged with reference to its intended recipient 
group. 

Crimes Against Public Decency, Morality and Public Peace 119 
(2) In prosecutions under this chapter, where 
circumstances of production, presentation, sale, 
distribution, or publicity indicate that matter is 
being commercially exploited by the defendant for 
the sake of its prurient appeal, that evidence is 
probative with respect to the nature of the matter 
and canjustify the conclusion that the matter lacks 
significant literary, artistic, political, educational, 
or scientific value. 
(3) In detennining whether the matter taken 
as a whole goes substantially beyond customary 
limits of candor in description or representation of 
such matters, the fact that the defendant knew that 
the matter depicts as persons under the age of 16 
years engaged in sexual conduct, as defined in (c) 
of Section 311.4, is a factor which can be consid­
ered in making that detennination. 
(b) "Matter" means any book, magazine, 
newspaper or other printed or written material or 
any picture, or other pictorial representation or 
any statue or other figure, or any recording, 
transcription or mechanical, chemical or electri­
cal reproduction or any other articles, equipment, 
machines or materials. 
(c) "Person" means any individual, part­
nership, finn, association, corporation, or other 
legal entity. 
(d) "Distribute" means to transfer posses­
sion of, whether with or without consideration. 
(e) "Knowingly" means being aware of the 
character of the matter or live conduct. 
(f) "Exhibit" means to show. 
(g) "Obscene live conduct" means any phys­
ical human body activity, whether performed or 
engaged in alone or with other persons including 
but not limited to singing, speaking, dancing, 
acting, simulating, or pantomiming, where, taken 
as a whole, the predominant appeal of such con­
duct to the average person, applying contempo­
rary statewide standards is to prurient interest, 
meaning a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, 
sex, or excretion; and is conduct which taken as a 
whole goes substantially beyond customary limits 
of candor in description or representation of such 
matters; and is conduct which taken as a whole 
lacks significant literary, artistic, political, educa­
tional, or scientific value. 
(1) The predominant appeal to prurient inter­
est of the conduct is judged with reference to average adults unless it appears from the nature of 
the conduct or the circumstances of its produc­
tion, presentation or exhibition, that it is designed 
for clearly defmed deviant sexual groups, in which. 
case the predominant appeal of the conduct shall 
be judged with reference to its intended recipient 
group. 
(2) In prosecutions under this chapter, where 
circumstances or production, presentation adver­
tising, or exhibition indicate that live conduct is 
being commercially exploited by the defendant for 
the sake of its prurient appeal, that evidence is 
probative with respect to the nature of the conduct 
and can justify the conclusion that the conduct 
lacks significant literary, artistic, political, educa­
tional, or scientific value. 
(3) In detennining whether the live conduct 
taken as a whole goes substantially beyond 
customary limits of candor in description or repre­
sentation of such matter, the fact that the defen­
dant knew that the live conduct depicts a person 
under the age of 16 years engaged in sexual 
conduct, as defined in subsection (c) of Section 
311.4, is a factor which can be considered in 
making that determination. 
13.5 Sale of Obscene Matter 
Penal Code 311.2 Sale or Distribution of 
Obscene Matter 
(a) Every person who knowingly sends or 
causes to be sent, or brings or causes to be

ing that the matter depicts a person under the age 
of 17 years personally engaging in or personally 
simulating sexual conduct, as defined in Section 
311.4 is guilty of a misdemeanor .... It is not 
necessary to prove commercial consideration or 
that the matter is obscene in order to establish a 
violation of this subdivision. If a person has been 
previously convicted of a violation of thIs subdivi­
sion, he or she is guilty of a felony. 
(d) Every person who knowingly sends or

years personally engaging in or personally sim­
ulating sexual conduct, as defined in Section 
311.4, is guilty of a felony . .. . 
(e) Sulxlivisions (a) and (d), inclusive, shall 
not apply to the activities of law enforcement and 
prosecuting agencies in the investigation and 
prosecution of criminal offenses or to legitimate 
medical, scientific, or educational activities, or to 
lawful conduct between spouses. 
(t) This section shall not apply to matter 
which depicts a child under the age of 18, which 
child is legally emancipated, including lawful 
conduct between spouses when one or both are 
under the age of 18. 
Discussion 
The offenses involving the sale or distribution 
of obscene matter requires that the offender 
"knowingly" distribute or sale obscene matter. 
The knowledge required is that of' 'being aware of 
the character of the matter" (36 So. Cal. L. Rev. 
537). As long as the offender is aware of the 
character of the matter, there is no requirement 
that he or she recognize it as obscene. 13.6 Child Sex Films

(a) A person is guilty of sexual exploitation of 
a child when he or she knowingly develops, dupli­
cates, prints, or exchanges any film, photograph,

sexual conduct. 
(b) As used in this section "sexual conduct" 
means any of the following: 
(1) Sexual intercourse, including genital-gen­
ital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal,

activities of law enforcement and prosecution 
agencies in the investigation and prosecution of 
criminal offenses or to legitimate medical, scien­
tific, or educational activities, or to lawful con­
duct between spouses. 
(d) Every person who violates sulxlivision (a)

section of this chapter, he or she is punishable by 
imprisonment in the state prison. 
(e) The provisions of this section shall not 
apply to an employee: of a commercial film

Discussion 
The U.S. Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade, 410 
U.S. 113, held that a woman's right to privacy 
under the federal constitution includes "a 
woman's decision whether or not to terminate her 
pregnancy". Under this case, a woman has a right 
to obtain an abortion during the first trimester of 
the pregnancy. During the second trimester, the 
state may place restrictions for the medical protec­
tion of the woman. During the third trimester, the 
state has the right to consider the protection of the 
unborn child. 
13.19 Gambling 
In California, not all gambling is illegal. The 
most common illegal forms of gambling are [sted 
below: 
1. Lottery (except the official state lottery). 
Lottery is defmed as any scheme for the 
disposal or distribution of property by 
chance, among persons who have paid or 
promised to give any valuable considera­
tion for the chance of obtaining such prop­
erty or a portion of it, or any interest in 
such property (p C 326.5). Note: a "foot­
ball pool" is a lottery, and therefore is 
illegal. The key phrase is "by chance." If 
the winning depends on skill, not chance, 
it may not be gambling. 
2. Chain letters. chain letters and pyramid 
schemes are a violation of P C 327. 
3. Bookmaking. Bookmaking is a violation 
ofP C 337a 
4. Operating an unlicensed gaming house is a 
violation of P C 330. 
5. Slot machines P C 330.1. 
13.20 Organized Crime 
The Organized Crime Bill (p C 186) provides 
that when selected other penal statutes are violated 
for financial gain, two or more times by organized 
crime or any person who is engaged in a "pattern 
of criminal profiteering," the offender(s) are 
guilty of criminal profiteering in addition to the 
other crimes involved. CLASSROOM DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

Forgery Defined 
At both common law and by statute, forgery is 
the making of a false instrument or the material 
alteration of an existing genuine instrument. The 
common law crime of uttering a forged document 
is also included in the statutory crime of forgery 
under PC 470. Uttering is the offering, passing or 
attempted passing of a false instrument with 
knowledge thereof and with the intent to defraud. Forgery is complete when one either makes or 
passes a false instrument with the intent to defraud 
(People v. Ross 198 CA 2d 723). The gist offorgery 
offenses is the "intent to defraud." Actual 
defrauding is not required (People v. Garin 174 CA 
2d 654). 
Elements of Forgery 
The elements of the crime of forgery (making 
a false document or alteration of a genuine instru­
ment) are: 
1. a false signature or material alteration 
2. signed or altered without authority 
3. a writing or other instrument that if gen­
uine, would have legal significance 
4. an intent to defraud 
The elements of the crime of forgery (utter­
ing, passing, publishing, or attempting to pass) 
are: 
1. a forged document that if genuine, would 
have legal significance 
2. uttering, passing, publishing, or attempt­
ing to pass the forged document with the 
intent to defraud. 
Discussion 
Forgery is a specific intent crime, in that a 
specific intent to defraud is a necessary element of 
the offense. The term "writing" includes printed 
or typewritten material. In one case, the accused 
was convicted of forgery where he signed his own 
name to a check. In this case, the defendant 
wrongly received a check that was made payable 
to another person with the same name as the 
defendant. The defendant knew that the check was 
not his and thus by signing his name with the 
intention of having it accepted as the other person's 
signature was forgery (Clark and Marshall, p. 
848). 
Fraud in the Inception 
Forgery may be committed by obtaining a 
genuine signature to an instrument by fraudulent 
representations regarding the nature of the docu­
ment. For example, a check signed in blank by a 
victim who was promised that it was to be used 
only as an example; it was later filled in without 
authority. The court held that this was a forgery 
(People v. Bartges 126 CA 2d 763). In another 
~ .. ------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------
Forgery, Counterfeiting and Check Offenses 127 
case, the defendant obtained the signature of a 
victim on a deed of trust by stating that the 
document was a contract. The court held that the 
crime offorgery was committed (People v. Parker 
11 CA 3d 500). 
Authority to Sign 
The prosecution must establish that there was 
a lack of authority to sign the other person's name. 
Accordingly, the implied authority to sign the 
other person's name is a defense. 
Instruments Subject to Forgery 
To be subject to forgery the instrument, if 
genuine, must create some legal right or obligation 
(have apparent legal significance). If the instru­
ment has no legal significance on its face, then it is 
not subject to forgery. If it has no legal signifi­
cance, but this is not apparent on its face, then the 
instrument is subject to forgery statutes. For 
example, the conviction for the forgery of a will 
was upheld on review even though the deceased 
had no estate (property) to pass under the will 
(People v. Bibby 91 C 470). 
Instruments which the courts have found to 
have apparent legal significance include: 
1. transcript of college record or college 
diploma (People v. Russel 214 CA 2d 445) 
2. letter of credit (People v. Kagan 264 CA 2d 
656) 
3. insurance form of proof of loss (People v. 
Di Ryana 8 CA 333) 
4. divorce decree (Ex parte Finley 66 C 262) 
5. signing false name to a charge slip while 
using a stolen credit card (People v. Searcy 
199 CA 2d 740) 
Alteration 
The alteration of a document is expressly 
included in PC 470. The general theory is that , 
when a genuine document is altered, it becomes a 
false document. To be forgery, however, alteration 
must be of a material part. For example, changing 
the date on a check from April 4 to Apri114 will 
not be a forgery unless the change in date has 
some legal significance. The alteration must result 
in some material change in the rights and obliga­
tions of the parties involved. For example, the 
material alteration of a check already made, with the intent to defraud another is forgery (People v. 
Brotherton 47 C 388). 
Intent 
An intent to defraud is a necessary element. 
The intent, however, may be inferred from cir­
cumstances (People v. Cullen 99 CA 2d 468). A 
general intent to defraud members of the public is 
sufficient. There is no requirement to establish 
that the defendant intended to defraud any par­
ticular person, as long as a general intent to 
defraud another is established (People v. Brown 
113 CA 492). 
Uttering 
The crime of "uttering a forgery" is the 
offense of trying to pass a forged document as 
genuine. To be gu:lty of this offense, the accused 
need not complete the passing or uttering of it. 
Attempting to pass is sufficient to constitute the 
offense (People v. Clark 233 CA 2d 725). A 
conviction of uttering a forgery was upheld where 
one defendant was caught attempting to cash a 
forged payroll check by representing to a cashier 
that he was the individual whose name was on the 
check (People v. Ford 233 CA 2d 725). Possession 
of a forged instrument with the intent to pass it is 
not forgery under P. C. 470. There must be at least 
an attempt to pass the false document. (Note: 
possession of a forged document may be a viola­
tion of the "possession" statutes.) 
14.2 Making False Entries in Records or 
Returns 
Penal Code 471 Making False Entries in Rec­
ords or Returns 
Every person who, with intent to defraud 
another, makes, forges, or alters any entry in any 
book of records, any instrument purporting to be 
any record or retum specified in the preceding 
section, is guilty of forgery. 
Penal Code 471.5 Falsifying Medical Records 
Any person who alters or modifies the medi­
cal record of any person, with fraudulent intent, or 
who, with fraudulent intent, creates any false 
medical records, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

14.3 Forgery of Corporate and Public Seals 
Penal Code 472 Forgery of Corporate and Pub­
lic Seals 
Any person who, with intent to defraud 
another, forges, or counterfeits the seal of this 
state, the seal of any public officer authorized by 
law, the seal of any court of record, or the seal of 
any corporation, or any other public seal autho­
rized or recognized by the laws of this state, or of 
any other state, government, or country, or who 
falsely makes, forges, or counterfeits any impres­
sion purporting to be an impression of any such 
seal, or who has in his possession any such 
counterfeited seal or impression thereof, knowing 
it to be counterfeited, and willfully conceals the 
same, is guilty of forgery. 
14.4 Sending False Messages 
Penal Code 474 False Messages 
Every person who knowingly and willfully 
sends by telegraph or telephone to any person a 
false or forged message, purporting to be from a 
telegraph or telephone office, or from any other 
person, or who willfully delivers or causes to be 
delivered to any other person any such message 
falsely purporting to have been received by tele­
graph or telephone, or who furnished to any agent, 
operator, or employee, to be sent by telegraph or 
telephone, or to be delivered, any such message, 
knowing the same to be false or forged, with the 
intent to deceive, injure, or defraud another, is 
punishable by imprisonment in the state prison ... 
or in the county jail .... 
Discussion 
The defendant was convicted of this offense 
for sending a telegraph message to her former 
husband stating that their 14 year old son had been 
killed and his remains cremated. Apparently, she 
was trying to defraud her ex-husband of his visita­
tion rights awarded by the court (people v. Tolstoy 
250 CA 2d 22). 
14.5 False Signature on Letter to Newspaper 
P C 538a makes it a misdemeanor to sign 
another person's name to a letter, and send it to a 
newspaper with the intent to cause the newspaper 
to believe that the letter was written by the person 
whose name is signed to the letter. 14.6 Filing Forged Instruments

offers any false or forged instrument to be filed, 
registered, or recorded in any public office within 
this state, which instrument, if genuine, might be

[Subsections (c) and (d) referring to punish­
ments are omitted.] 
Penal Code 115.5 Filing False or Forged Docu­
ments or Instruments 
(a) Every person who files any false or forged 
document or instrument with the county recorder 
which affects title to, places an encumbrance on, 
or places an interest secured by a mortgage or 
deed or trust on, real property consisting of a 
single-family residence containing not more than 
four dwelling units, with knowledge that the docu­
ment is false or forged is punishable. .. . 
(b) Every person who makes a false sworn 
statement to a notary public, with knowledge that 
the statement is false, to induce the notary public 
to perform an improper notarial act on an instru­
ment or document affecting title to, or placing an 
encumbrance on, real property containing not 
more than four dwelling units is guilty of a felony. 
Discussion 
The above offenses required that the filing or 
offering for filing or the making of a false sworn 
statement to a notary public be "with the knowl­
edge" that the documents or statements are forged 
or false. There is no requirement, however, to 
establish an "intent to defraud." 
14.7 Altering Certified Copies of Official 
Records 
Penal Code 115.3 Altering Certified Copies of 
Official Records 
Any person who alters a certified copy of an 
official record, or knowingly furnishes an altered 
certified copy of an official record, of this state, 

Forgery. Counterfeiting and Check Offenses 129 
including the executive, legislative, and judicial 
branches thereof, or of any city, county, city and 
county, district, or political subdivision thereof, is 
guilty of a misdemeanor. 
Discussion 
The above offense of altering certified copies 
of official records does not require an • 'intent to 
defraud. " The mere altering of certified copies is 
sufficient to constitute the offense. 
14.8 Possession of Forged Bills 
Penal Code 475 Forged or Unfinished Bills or 
Notes, Possession 
Every person who has in his possession, or 
receives from another person, any forged prom­
issory note or bank bill, or bills, or any counter­
feited trading stamp, or stamps, or lottery ticket or 
share purporting to be issued under the California 
State Lottery Act of1984, or tickets or shares, for 
the payment of money or property, with the inten­
tion to pass the same, or to permit, cause, or 
procure the person, knowing the same to be forged 
or counterfeited, or has or keeps in his or her 
possession any blank or unfinished note or bank 
bill made in the form or similitude of any prom­
issory note or bill for payment of money or prop­
erty, made to be issued by any incorporated bank 
or banking company, or any blank or unfinished 
check, money order, or traveler's check, whether 
the parties thereto are real or fictitious, with 
intention to fill up and complete the blank and 
unfmished note or bill, check, money order, or 
traveler's check, or to permit, or cause, orprocure 
the same, or to permit, or cause, or procure the 
same to be uttered or passed, to defraud any 
person, is punishable by imprisonment in the state 
prison, or by imprisonment in the county jail .... 
Penal Code 475a Fraudulent Possession of 
Money Order, Warrant or Completed Check 
Every person who has in his possession a 
completed check, money order, traveler's check, 
controller's warrant for the payment of money at 
the treasury, or county order or warrant, whether 
the parties thereto are real or fictitious, with 
intention to utter or pass the same, or to permit, 
cause, or procure the same to be uttered orpassed, to defraud any person, is punishable by imprison­
ment in the state prison, or by imprisonment in tile 
county jail .... 
Penal Code 476 Possessing Fictitious Bill, Note 
or Check 
Every person who makes, passes, utters, or 
publishes, with intention to defraud any other 
person, or who, with the like intention, attempts to 
pass, utter, or publish, or who has in his posses­
sion, with like intent to utter, pass, or publish, any 
fictitious bill, note, or check, purporting to be the 
bill, note, or check, or other instrument in writing 
for the payment of money or property of some 
bank, corporation, copartnership, or individual, 
when, in fact, there is no such bank, corporation, 
copartnership, or individual in existence knowing 
the bill, note, check, or instrument in writing to be 
fictitious, is punishable by imprisonment in the 
county jail ... or ... in the state prison. 
Discussion 
For the "possession" to be crime, the posses­
sion must be with the knowledge that the instru­
ment was false or was not genuine. Each 
instrument possessed constitutes a separate crime. 
14.9 Check Offenses 
Penal Code 476a Delivering or Making Check 
With Insufficient Funds 
(a) Any person, who for himself or as the 
agent or representative of another or as an officer 
of a corporation, willfully, with intent to defraud, 
makes or draws or utters or delivers any check, 
draft or order upon any bank or depository, of 
person, orfirm, or corporation, for the payment of 
money, knowing at the time of such making, 
drawing, uttering or delivering that the maker or 
drawer or the corporation has not sufficient funds 
in, or credit with said bank or depository, or 
person, or firm, or corporation, for the payment of 
such check, draft, or order and all other checks, 
drafts, or orders upon such funds then outstand­
ing, in full upon its presentation, although no 
express representation is made with reference 
thereto, is punishable by imprisonment in the 
county jail . . . . 
(b) However, if the total amount of all such 
checks, drafts, or orders that the defendant is 

130 Chapter 14 
charged with and convicted of making, drawing, 
or uttering does not exceed two hundred dollars 
($200), the offense is punishable only by 
imprisonment in the county j ail for not more than 
one year, except that this subdivision shall not be 
applicable if the defendant ... [has a previous 
conviction of this Section or Sections 470, 475, or 
476.] 
(c) Where such check, draft, or order is pro­
tested, on the ground of insufficiency of funds or 
credit, the notice of protest thereof shall be 
admissable as proof of presentation, nonpayment 
and protest and shall be presumptive evidence or 
knowledge of insufficiency of funds or credit with 
such bank or depositary, or person, or firm, or 
corporation. 
(d) In any prosecution under this section 
involving two or more checks, drafts, or orders, it 
shall constitute prima facie evidence of the iden­
tity of the drawer of a check, draft, or order if: 
(1) At the time of the acceptance of such 
check, draft or order from the drawer by the payee 
there is obtained from the drawer the following 
information: name and residence of the drawer, 
business or mailing address, either a valid driver's 
license number or Department of Motor Vehicles 
identification card number, and the drawer's home 
or work phone number or place of employment. 
Such information may be recorded on the check, 
draft, or order itself or may be retained on file by 
the payee and referred to on the check, draft, or 
order by identifying number or other similar 
means; and 
(2) The person receiving the check, draft, or 
order witnesses the drawer's signature or endorse­
ment, and, as evidence of that, initials the check, 
draft, or order at the time of the receipt. 
(e) The word "credit" as used herein shall be 
construed to mean an arrangement or understand­
ing with the bank or depository or person or firm 
or corporation for the payment of such check, 
draft or order. 
(f) [Omitted.] 
Elements 
The elements of the offeulle of delivering or 
making a check with insufficient funds are: 
1. the making of, uttering or the delivery of 
2. a check, draft or order, 3. with the intent to defraud, 
4. for the payment of money or property, 
5. with knowledge that at the time of the 
making, delivering or uttering, there were 
insufficient funds or credit to cover the 
check, draft or order. 
Discussion 
In most cases, the conduct required to estab­
lish a violation of this offense, also, is sufficient to 
constitute theft. A critical problem with the pros­
ection of most theft by check offenses is in estab­
lishing the identify of the maker or presenter of the 
check. This problem is made easier by the pre­
sumptions contained in (d) (1) above. The eviden­
tiary presumptions, therefore, make it easier in 
most cases to establish a violation of this statute 
rather than the theft statute. 
While this section requires an intent to 
defraud, it is not necessary to establish that any 
person was actually defrauded. It does require 
proof that at the time of the making, uttering, or 
delivery that the defendant knew that he or she had 
neither sufficient funds or credit with the bank, 
etc. to cover the check, draft or order. 
14.10 Counterfeiting 
Penal Code 477 Counterfeiting Coin, Bullion, 
etc. 
Every person who counterfeits lmy of the 
species of gold or silver coin current in this state, 
or any kind of species of gold-dust, gold or silver 
bullion, or bars, lumps, pieces, ornuggets, or who 
sell, passes, or gives in payment such counterfeit 
coin, dust, bullion, bars, lumps, pieces, or nug­
gets, or pelmits, with intention to defraud any 
person, knowing the same to be counterfeited, is 
guilty of counterfeiting. 
Penal Code 479 Counterfeit Gold or Silver 
Coins, etc. 
Every person who has in his possession, or 
receives for any other person, any counterfeit gold 
or silver coin of the species current in this state, or 
any counterfeit gold dust, gold or silver bullion or 
bars, lumps, pieces or nuggets, with the intention 
to sell, utter, put off or pass the same, or permits, 
causes or procures the same to be sold, uttered or 
passed, with intention to defraud any person, 

Forgery, Counterfeiting and Check Offenses 131 
lmowing the same to be counterfeit, is punishable 
by imprisonment in the state prison .... 
Penal Code 480 Possessing or Making Counter­
feit Dies or Plates 
Every person who makes, or lmowingly has in 
his possession any die, plate, or any apparatus, 
paper, metal, machine, or other thing whatever, 
made use of in counterfeiting coin current in this 
state, or in counterfeiting gold dust, gold or silver 
bars, bullion, lumps, pieces, or nuggets, or in 
counterfeiting bank notes or bills, is punishable by 
imprisonment in the state prison . .. and all such 
dies, plates, apparatus, paper, metal, or machine, 
intended for the purpose aforesaid, must be 
destroyed. 
Discussion 
Counterfeiting of U.S. currency is a federal 
crime and is subject to prosecution in U.S. District 
Courts. It is also a state crime and the states have 
concurrent power to punish (In re Dixon 41 C 2d 
756). By statute, counterfeiting includes more 
than the making of phony currency. For example, 
a conviction for the counterfeiting of parimutuel 
tickets was upheld in one case. Note: the intent to 
defraud is similar to that required for forgery 
(People v. Bratis 73 CA 3d 751). 
14.11 Ticket Scalping 
Penal Code 483 Ticket Scalping 
Except as otherwise provided . . . any person 
... that shall sell to another any ticket, pass, scrip, 
mileage or commutation book, coupon, or other 
instrument for passage on a common carrier, for 
the use of any person not entitled to use the same 
according to the terms of the book or portion 
thereoffrom which it was detached, shall be guilty 
of a misdemeanor. 
Discussion 
Unlike forgery or counterfeiting, ticket scalp­
ing is a general intent crime. This crime also 
differs in that there is no requirement to establish 
an intent to defraud as a necessary element. For 
example, most sports tickets have restrictions 
printed on them limiting their transfer or resale. 
Accordingly, reselling the tickets in violation of 
the ticket restrictions is an offense under this 
section. CLASSROOM DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 
1. Explain the difference between the crimes of 
possession of forged instruments and utteling 
a forged document. 
2. Bob writes a check to pay his rent. At the 
time of writing his check, he thinks that he 
has sufficient credit with the bank to cover 
the check. Two days prior, however, he had 
received a letter from his bank indicating tl1at 
his line of credit was cancelled. Bob had 
misread the letter and thought that it had 
increased his line of credit. Has he com­
mitted a check offense under PC 476a? 
3. Joe finds four tickets to the UCLA/USC 
football game. He needs money to pay his 
tuition to UC. He attempts to sell the tickets. 
What crime(s), if any, has he committed? 
4. Jim White has the same name as a famous 
football player. He writes a letter to the news­
paper regarding football. The newspaper 
thinking the letter is from the famous Jim 
White publishes it. What crime(s), if any, has 
Jim committed? 
5. Mike asks Jerry to cash his check for him 
(Mike) at the local bank. Mike forgets to 
endorse the check. Jerry realizing this signs 
Mike's name to the check, cashes it and gives 
the money to Mike. Is Jerry guilty of forgery? 
6. Susan finds a check with the name of the 
payee blank. She fills in her name and cashes 
the check. What crimes has she committed?

sion (a) of Section 11100 with knowledge or the 
intent that the recipient will use the substance to 
unlawfully manufacture a controlled substance is 
guilty of a felony. 
15.5 Permits for Sale, Transfer, etc. 
H & S 11106 requires that any manufacturer, 
wholesaler, etc., who sells, transfers, etc. any of 
the controlled substances listed in section 11100 
must obtain a permit prior to the transfer from the 
State Department of Justice. Permits may be 
granted for a maximum period of one year. 
15.6 Prescriptions 
Only physicians, dentists, podiatrists or vet­
erinarians or pharmacists acting within the provi­
sions of Article 18 of the Health and Safety Code 
and registered nurses under certain circumstances 
may write prescriptions. Some of the general rules 
on writing and filling prescriptions include: 

136 Chapter 15 
1. No person shall write, issue, fill, com­
pound or dispense a prescription except 
as authorized by the Act. 
2. Prescriptions for a controlled substance 
shall only be issued for a legitimate medi­
cal purpose. 
3. Both the prescribing practitioner and the 
pharmacist filling the prescription have 
the responsibility to ensure that only 
legal prescriptions are filled. 
4. It is unlawful to solicit, directly or indi­
rectly, any person to prescribe, fill, etc. 
an illegal prescription. 
5. No person shall issue a prescription that 
is false or fictitious in any respect. 
6. No person shall issue, prescribe, admin­
ister, etc., a controlled substance to an 
addict except as permitted under the Act. 
7. With minor exceptions, controlled sub­
stances classified under Schedules II, 
III, IV and V may not be dispensed 
without a prescription. 
8. In most cases, a maximum of 72-hour 
supply of a Schedule II substance may be 
dispensed pursuant to a valid 
prescription. 
9. Prescription blanks are issued by the 
State Department of Justice in serially 
numbered groups of not more than 100 
forms each in triplicate. 
10. Possession of unauthorized prescription 
blanks or counterfeit blanks is a criminal 
offense under the Act. 
11. The giving of a false name or address in 
connection with prescribing, dispensing, 
etc. of a controlled substance is unlawful. 
12. Records of all prescriptions prescribed, 
dispensed, etc. shall be maintained for a 
period of at least three years. 
13. Records shall contain, at least, the fol­
lowing information: 
a. name and address of the patient, 
b. date, 
c. character and quantity of controlled 
substances involved, and 
d. pathology and purpose for which th~ 
prescription was issued (or in the case of 
the pharmacist, the name and address of 
the prescriber of the controlled substance). 15.7 Unlawful Possession 
It is unlawful to possess any controlled sub­
stance except as permitted by law. In most cases, 
the unlawful possession is a felony (H & S 
11350-11356). The possession of substances under 
Schedules III, IV or V may in most cases be 
treated by the court as a misdemeanor (wobbler). 
Possession for purposes of sale or distribution is 
an aggravated form of possession. There are two 
types of possession; actual and constructive. 
Actual possession is where the individual has the 
substance in his or her possession. Constructive 
possession is where the substance is possessed by 
someone else, but the defendant has control of it. 
The elements of unlawful possession are: 
1. the person had possession or the right to 
exercise control of a controlled substance, 
2. the possession is unlawful, 
3. the person had knowledge of the nature of 
the substance, and 
4. the amount of substance possessed was a 
usable quantity. Note: While a usable 
amount must be possessed, there is no 
requirement that the amount be sufficient 
to produce a narcotic effect (People v. 
Piper 19 CA 3d 248). 
15.8 Unlawful Manufacture, Import, Sale, 
etc. of Controlled Substance 
H & S 11379 makes it a felony to illegally 
transport, import, manufacture, sale, etc. of a 
controlled substance listed under Schedules III, 
IV and V. 
15.9 Marijuana 
Possession 
The possession of less than 28.5 grams of 
marijuana (any concentrated cannabis) is nor­
mally a misdemeanor (H & S 11357). 
Cultivation 
Every person who plants, cultivates, harvests, 
dries, or processes any marijuana or any part 
thereof, except as otherwise provided by law, shall 
be punished by imprisonment in the state prison 
(felony) (H & S 11358). 

Controlled Substances and Alcohol Related Crimes 137 
Possession for Sale 
Every person who possesses for sale any 
marijuana, except as otherwise provided by law, 
shall be punished by imprisonment in the state 
prison (felony) (H & S 11359). 
Transportation, Distribution, or Importation 
Except as provided for by law, every person 
who transpOlts, imports into the state, sells, fur­
nishes, etc. marijuana is guilty of a felony (H & S 
11360). If the amount is less than 28.5 grams of 
marijuana other than concentrated cannabis, the 
offense is a misdemeanor. 
Minors 
The employment or using of minors in the 
unlawful selling, distributing, etc. of marijuana is 
a felony. It is also a felony for an adult to dis­
tribute, give, sell, etc. marijuana to a minor (H & 
S 11361). 
15.10 Peyote 
Health and Safety Code 11363 
Every person who plants, cultivates, harvests, 
dries, or processes any plant of the genus 
Lophophora, also known as peyote, or any part 
thereof shall be punished by imprisonment in the 
county jail .... [A misdemeanor offense.] 
15.11 Possession of Paraphernalia for Unlaw­
ful Use 
Section 11364 makes it unlawful to possess an 
opium pipe or any device, etc. used for unlawfully 
injecting or smoking a controlled substance. 
15.12 Presence During Unlawful Use 
It is unlawful to visit or to be in any room or 
place where any controlled substances are being 
unlawfully used, smoked, etc. (H & S 11365) 
15.13 Driving Under the Influence Vehicle 
Code 23152 Driving While Under Influence of 
Alcohol or Drugs 
(a) It is unlawful for any person who is under 
the influence of an alcoholic be.verage or any 
drug, or under the combined influence of an 
alcoholic beverage and any drug, to drive a 
vehicle. (b) It is unlawful for any person who has 
0.08 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in 
his/her blood to drive a vehicle. 
For purposes of this subdivision, percent, by 
weight, of alcohol shall be based upon grams of 
alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. 
In any prosecution under this subdivision, it 
is a rebuttable presumption that the person has 
0.08 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in 
his/her blood at the time of driving the vehicle 
if the person had 0.10 percent or more, by 
weight, of alcohol in his/her blood at the time of 
the performance of a chemical test within three 
hours after the driving. 
(c) It is unlawful for any person who is 
addicted to the use of any drug to drive a vehicle. 
This subdivision shall not apply to a person who is 
participating in a methadone maintenance treat­
ment program .... 
Discussion 
There are three offenses under Vehicle Code 
23152: 
1. driving under the influence, 
2. driving with a blood alcohol content of 
0.08 or higher, and 
3. driving by a person who is addicted to the 
use of any drug, unless the person is on 
an approved methadone maintenance treat­
ment program. 
Prior to 1982, the above offenses were only 
committed by driving on a public highway. In 
1982, the section was changed to remove the 
public highway requirement. The section now 
applies to highways and elsewhere within the 
state. Note: as discussed under the laws of arrest, 
normally a misdemeanor must be committed in 
the presence of the officer before an officer has the 
authority to make a misdemeanor arrest without a 
warrant. DWI/DUI offenses, however, are excep­
tions to this rule (P C 836). 
Under the Influence 
"Under the influence" means that alcohol or 
drugs or a combination thereof have so affected 
the nervous system, the brain, or muscles as to 
impair to an appreciable degree the ability of the 
person to operate a motor vehicle in an ordinary 
and cautious manner (People v. Byrd 125 CA 3d 

138 Chapter 15 
1054). "Under the influence" does not require that 
the driver be "drunk" (People v. Haeussler 41 C 
2d 252). 
The drug involved may be a prescribed drug 
and need not be illegal. For example, where the 
accused is stopped for driving under the influence, 
it is not a defense that the drugs were duly pre­
scribed and were taken according to the doctor's 
directions (People v. Keith 184 CA 2d Supp. 884). 
For the offense of driving while a drug addict, 
it is not necessary to establish that the driver was 
under the influence of drugs at the time he or she 
was driving. All that is necessary is that the 
defendant is a drug addict and operated a vehicle 
during the time he or she was addicted (People v. 
Diaz 234 CA 2d 818 and People v. O'Neil 62 CA 
2d 748). 
Driver Defined 
The driver is the person who drives or is in 
actual physical control of the vehicle (Vehicle 
Code, Section 305). The person steering the vehi­
cle is considered the driver, even if the vehicle is 
being towed or pushed by another vehicle. The 
identity of the driver may be proven by circum­
stantial evidence (People v. Moreno 188 CA3d 
1179). 
Driving 
To constitute "driving" for purposes of 
DWIjDuI statutes, some movement of the vehicle 
is necessary. It need only be a slight movement. 
The movement may be coasting downhill or ped­
aling a mo-ped, as long as the vehicle is capable of 
moving under its own power. A movement of a few 
feet is sufficient (People v. Padilla 184 CA 3d 
1022). 
Vehicle 
A vehicle is defined as any device which 
permits persons or property to be propelled, 
drawn, or moved upon a public highway, except a 
device moved exclusively by human power (Vehi­
cle Code, Section 670). The definition includes 
animal-drawn vehicles, go-carts, forklifts, snow­
mobiles, bulldozers, mopeds and mobile cranes 
(People v. Jordan 75 CA 3d Supp. 1). Note: there 
are separate code sections applying to operating a bicycle under the influence (Vehicle Code, Sec­
tions 21200 and 21200.5). 
15.14 Felony Drunk Driving 
Vehicle Code 23153 Driving While Under the 
Influence of Alcohol or Drugs -Causing 
Injury 
(a) It is unlawful for any person, while under 
the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any 
drug, or under the combined influence of an 
alcoholic beverage and any drug, to drive a vehi­
cle and, when so driving, do any act forbidden by 
law or neglect any duty imposed by law in the 
driving of the vehicle, which act or neglect prox­
imately causes bodily injury to any person other 
than the driver. 
(b) It is unlawful for any person while 
having 0.08 percent or more, by weight, of 
. alcohol in hislher blood to drive a vehicle and, 
when so driving, do any act forbidden by law or 
neglect any duty imposed by law in the driving of 
the vehicle, which act or neglect proximately . 
causes bodily injury to any person other than the 
driver .... 
(c) In proving the person neglected any duty 
imposed by law in the driving of the vehicle, it is 
not necessary to prove that any specific section of 
this code was violated. 
Discussion 
The above offenses are similar to those set 
forth under Vehicle Code Section 23152 (a) and 
(b) with the below two additional requirements: 
1. bodily injury to any person other than the 
defendant, and 
2. the injury was caused by an act or failure 
to act which constitutes a violation of the 
code or of a duty imposed by the code. 
15.15 Operating an Aircraft or Boat While 
under the Influence 
There are various code provisions which 
make it unlawful to operate an aircraft or boat 
while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The 
restrictions are similar to those for driving a 
vehicle, except that it is illegal to operate an 
aircraft (on the ground or in the air) with a blood 
alcohol level of .04 or more. 

Controlled Substances and Alcohol Related Crimes 139 
15.16 Juveniles 
Vehicle Code 23140 Driving While Under the 
Influence of Alcohol- Under Age 18 
(a) It is unlawful for a person under the age of 
18 years who has 0.05 percent or more, by weight, 
of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a vehicle. 
(b) A person may be found to be in violation 
of subdivision (a) if the person was, at the time of 
driving, under the age of 18 years and under the 
influence of, or affected by an alcoholic beverage 
regardless of whether a chemical test was made to 
determine that person's blood-alcohol concentra­
tion and if the trier offact finds that the person had 
consumed an alcoholic beverage and was driving a 
vehicle while having a concentration of 0.05 per­
cent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her 
blood. 
Discussion 
Vehicle Code 23140 makes it unlawful for a 
juvenile whose blood alcohol level is .05 or more 
to drive a vehicle. A violation under this section 
may be established even if no chemical test was 
taken. Note: this section applies only to driving 
under the influence of alcohol and does not apply 
to driving under the influence of drugs. If this 
section does not apply, the juvenile may still be 
prosecuted under regular DWI/DUI offenses. 
15.17 Chemical Test Advisement 
Under the provisions of Vehicle Code, Section 
23157, prior to asking a driver to submit to a 
chemical test, the driver must be advised of the 
following items: 
1. Refusal to submit to, or failure to com­
plete, a chemical test will result in suspen­
sion or revocation of his or her driving 
license and mandatory imprisonment 
upon conviction. 
2. He or she has a choice of either blood, 
breath or urine test. Note: if taken to a 
medical facility for treatment, the driver 
must take what evertests are available. 
3. A refusal to take or a failure to complete a 
test may be used in court against the driver 
as evidence that the driver was driving in 
violation of Vehicle Code Sections 23152, 
or 23153. 4. The driver has no right to consult with 
counsel prior to taking the test or making a 
choice of which test to take. 
5. Ifhe or she is unable to complete one test, 
he or she must submit to another one. 
Note: Miranda warnings are not required during 
field investigations prior to an arrest.

Chapter 16 
Modification of the Law 
He who does not prevent a crime when he can, encourages it. 
(William Seneca) 
16.1 Appellate Court Decisions 
When the U. S. Constitution was written, it 
was expected that the judicial branch would not be 
involved in the modification of laws. Under the 
separation of powers doctrine, this duty was dele­
gated to the legislative branch. Appellate courts 
do, however, make law and modify existing laws 
through court decisions interpreting the constitu­
tion and statutes. The judicial legislation is indi­
rect and a "spinoff' of the judicial duties of the 
appellate courts. If the actions of the legislature 
are within its scope of power and do not violate 
any constitutional protections, the courts do not 
pass on the reasonableness, wisdom, and pro­
priety of the law (People v. Ferguson 129 CA 300). 
16.2 United States Supreme Court Decisions 
The U. S. Supreme COUlt has been a leader in 
modifying criminal law and procedure. As the 
results of the "criminal justice revolution" started 
by the Warren Court (the Court during Chief 
Justice Earl Warren's tenure: 1953-69), every 
major stage of the criminal justice process has 
been substantially modified since 1962 (Israel and 
LaFave, Criminal Procedure: Constitutional Lim­
itations). Every Supreme Court term since 1962, 
has resulted in judicial decisions by the court 
which have changed the criminal justice system. 
Changes in the court membership in the past eight 
years has, however, created a new court. The 
directions that the new court will take will proba­
bly continue to modify or fine tune the criminal 
141 justice system. For the U. S. Supreme Court to 
modify California criminal law, however, the 
decisions must be based on the U. S. Constitution 
or federal law. 
Clear examples of the U. S. Supreme COUlt 
modifying the law are the Miranda and the Mapp 
v. Ohio cases. In both of these cases, the court 
modified the existing law. Note: the modifications 
were accomplished even though the court has only 
the power to approve or reverse a lower court 
conviction. 
16.3 California Supreme Court Decisions 
The California Supreme Court makes the 
final decision on those issues involving the Penal 
Code which do not involve federal constitutional 
rights or federal law. The court's authority like 
that of the U. S. Supreme Court is limited only to 
approvals or disapprovals of lower court deci­
sions. With the 1986 changes in personnel on the 
court, this court is also a new court. 
16.4 Development of California Statutory 
Law 
Article IV, Section 1, of the California 
Constitution 
The legislative power of this state is vested in 
the California Legislature which consists of Sen­
ate and Assembly, but the people reserve to them­
selves the powers of initiative and referendum. 

142 Chapter 16 
Discussion 
In California, as in other states and the federal 
government, all statutory laws must be initiated 
by the state legislature or by referendum or initia­
tive. The modification of laws or the creation of 
new laws by referendum or initiative is discussed 
in Chapter 1. 
The California legislature is made up of two 
houses, the Senate and the Assembly. Each house 
can initiate a new statute or modification to an 
existing one. The new law or modification, 
however, must be approved by both houses before 
it is sent to the Governor for final action. If the 
governor signs the bill, it becomes the law. If the 
governor vetoes the bill, it goes back to the 
legislature. If both houses of the legislature over­
ride the governor's veto by a two-thirds vote in 
each house, the bill becomes law. Unless the 
enactment is an emergency measure, there will be 
a "cooling off' period before it is effective. The 
effects of repeal and amendment of statutes are 
discussed in Glapter 1. 
When a new law or modification is introduced 
by a house member, it is called a "bill." If and 
when the bill becomes law, it is then considered as 
a "statute." If it is a general statute, it will be 
integrated into one of the state's twenty-seven 
codes. 
The twenty-seven different codes in Califor-
nia are: 
1. Business and Professions Code (B & P) 
2. Civil Code (C C) 
3. Code of Civil Procedure (C C P) 
4. Commercial Code (Com. C) 
5. Corporations Code (Corp. C) 
6. Education Code (Educ. C) 
7. Elections Code (Elec. C) , 
8. Evidence Code (Evid. C) 
9. Financial Code (Fin. C) 
10. Fish and Game Code (Fish & Game C) 
11. Food an.d Agricultural Code (F & Arig. 
C) 
12. Government Code (Govt. C) 
13. Harbors & Navigation Code (Harb. & 
Nav. C) 
14. Health and Safety Code (H & S C) 
15. Insurance Code (Ins. C) 16. Labor Code (Lab. C) 
17. Military & Veterans Code (Mil. & Vet. 
C) 
18. Penal Code (P C) 
19. Probate Code (prob. C) 
20. Public Resources Code (Pub. Res. C) 
21. Public Utilities Code (Pub. Ut. C) 
22. Revenue and Taxation Code (Rev. C) 
23. Streets and Highways Code (Sts. & H C) 
24. Unemployment Insurance Code (Unemp. 
Ins. C) 
25. Vehicle Code (V C) 
26. Water Code (Water C) 
27. Welfare & Institutions Code (Welf. C) 
16.5 City and County Ordinances 
City and county ordinances are enacted to fit 
the special needs oflocal cities or counties. Since 
cities and counties derive their power from state 
charters, they have only the power to enact ordi­
nances as granted by the state. Local ordinances 
are normally modified by action oflocal boards of 
supervisors and city and town councils. 
16.6 United States Code 
The basic statutory law of the United States 
(federal law) is contained in the United States 
Code (U.S.C.). The code is divided into 50 gen­
eral subject areas, called "titles". The titles are 
numbered from 1 to 50. Title 18 is the federal 
criminal code. In citing the U. S. Code, the title 
number is cited first, then U.S.C. then section 
number. For example 18 U.S.C. 302 defines the 
federal crime of arson. Changes to the U. S. Code 
are made by statutes which originate in one of the 
houses of Congress. Note: appropriations bills 
may originate only in the House of 
Representatives. 
Note: often the cite is to the "annotated" 
code. In the above example, the cite for arson 
under the federal code would be 18 U.S.C.A. 302. 
"Annotated codes" contain, in addition to the 
official text of the code, historical information on 
the text, cross-references to legal sources and 
notes on court decisions regarding the text. 

Modification of the Law 143 
16.7 Victims Bill of Rights 
California Constitution, Article I, Section 28 
(proposition 8) 
(a) The People of the State of California find 
and declare that the enactment of comprehensive 
provisions and laws ensuring a bill of rights for 
victims of crime, including safeguards in the 
criminal justice system to fully protect those 
rights, is a matter of grave statewide concern. The 
rights of victims pervade the criminal justice 
system, encompassing not only the right to res­
titution from the wrongdoers for financial losses 
suffered as a result of criminal acts, but also the 
more basic expectation that persons who commit 
felonious acts causing injury to innocent victims 
will be appropriately detained in custody, tried by 
the courts, and sufficiently punished so that the 
public safety is protected and encouraged as a goal 
of highest importance. Such public safety extends 
to public primary, elementary, junior high, and 
senior high school campuses, where students and 
staff have the right to be safe and secure in their 
persons. 
To accomplish these goals, broad refonus in 
the procedural treatment of accused persons and 
the disIX>sition and sentencing of convicted per­
sons are necessary and proper as deterrents to 
criminal behavior and to serious disruption of 
people's lives. 
(b) Restitution. It is the unequivocal inten­
tion of the People of the State of California that all 
persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal 
activity shall have the right to restitution fTom the 
persons convicted of the crimes for losses they 
suffer. 
Restitution shall be ordered from the con­
victed persons in every case, regardless of the 
sentence or disIX>sition imposed, in which a crime 
victim suffers a loss, unless compelling and extra­
ordinary reasons exist to the contrary. The Legis­
lature shall adopt provisions to implement this 
section during the calendar year following adop­
tion of this section. 
(c) Right to Safe Schools. All students and 
staff of public primary, elementary, junior high 
and senior high schools have the inalienable right 
to attend campuses which are safe, secure and 
peaceful. (d) Right to Truth-in-Evidence. Except as 
provided by statute hereafter enacted by a two­
thirds vote of the membership in each house of the 
Legislature, relevant evidence shall not be 
excluded in any criminal proceeding, including 
pretrial and post conviction motions and hearings, 
or in any trial or hearing of a juvenile for a 
criminal offense, whether heard in juvenile or 
adult court. Nothing in this section shall affect any 
existing statutory rule of evidence relating to 
privilege or hearsay, or Evidence Code, Sections 
352, 782, or 1103. Nothing in this section shall 
affect any existing statutory or constitutional right 
of the press. 
(e) Public Safety Bail. A person may be 
released on bail by sufficient sureties, except for 
capital crimes when the facts are evident or the 
presumption great. Excessive bail may not be 
required. In setting bail, reducing or denying bail, 
the judge or magistrate shall take into considera­
tion the protection of the public, the seriousness of 
the offense charged, the previous criminal record 
of the defendant, and the probability of his or her 
appearing at the trial or hearing of the case. Public 
safety shall be the primary consideration. 
A person may be released on his or her own 
recognizance in the court's discretion, subject to 
the same factors considered in setting bail. 
However, no person charged with the commission 
of any serious felony shall be released on his or her 
own recognizance. 
Before any person arrested for a serious fel­
ony may be released on. bail, a hearing may be held 
before the magistrate or judge, and the prosecut­
ing attorney shall be given notice and reasonable 
opportunity to be heard on the matter. When a 
judge or magistrate grants or denies bailor release 
on a person's own recognizance, the reasons for 
that decision shall be stated in the record and 
included in the court's minutes. 
(f) Use of Prior Convictions. Any prior felony 
conviction of any person in any criminal proceed­
ing, whether adult or juvenile, shall subsequently 
be used without limitation for purposes of 
impeachment or enhancement of sentence in any 
criminal proceeding. When a prior felony convic­
tion is an element of any felony offense, it shall be 
proven to the trier of fact in open court. 

144 Chapter 16 
(g) As used in this article, the term "serious 
felony" is any crime defined in Penal Code, Sec­
tion 1192.7(c). 
Discussion 
Proposition 8, better known as "Victim's Bill 
of Rights, " was passed by the California voters on 
June 9, 1982. The proposition changed the law 
regarding diminished capacity, right to bail, 
standing, restitution, plea bargaining, the use of 
prior felony convictions for impeachment and the 
use of the exclusionary rule for violations of the 
state constitution. Proposition 8 is applicable only 
to prosecutions for crimes committed on or after 
its effective date of June 9, 1982 (People v. Smith 
34 C 3d 251). 
Truth in Eyidence 
The primary purpose of ' 'Truth in Evidence" 
portion of Proposition 8 was to eliminate the 
"independent state grounds" as a basis for the 
, 'exclusionary rule." The cases of In re Lance W., 
(37 C 3d 873) and People v. May (44 C 3d 309) 
indicate that Proposition 8 has achieved this 
purpose. 
In the case of In re Lance W. (37 C 3d 873), the 
State Supreme Court ruled that Proposition 8 
changed the remedy for a violation of the substan­
tial rights of citizens under the state constitution. 
That "independent state grounds" is no longer a 
basis for excluding evidence from a trial. Lance W 
addressed unreasonable searches and seizures 
(Fourth Amendment problems). People v. May (44 
C 3d 309) held that Proposition 8 had the same 
effect with regard to the Fifth and Sixth Amend­
ments, i.e., confessions, Miranda problems, and 
right to counsel. [Note: now only a violation of a 
"federal constitutional" right will be the basis for 
excluding evidence under the exclusionary rule.] 
Bail Provisions 
Proposition 8 provided that a judge or magis­
trate may consider in setting, reducing or denying 
bail the "protection of the public. " The P C 1275 
now provides that public safety is the primary 
consideration is setting bail. 
In upholding the constitutionality of this sec­
tion, a California Court of Appeals held in the 
case of In re Nordin (143 CA 3d 538), that since pretrial detention is a regulatory matter not penal, 
the denial of bail does not deprive the defendant of 
his constitutional right to trial by jury. The Eighth 
Amendment's prohibition against excessive bail is 
a limitation on the amount of bail that ajudge may 
impose, but is not a limitation of a state's right to 
regulate eligibility for bail. 
Restitution 
Proposition 8 provided that restitution shall be 
ordered from a convicted person to the victim 
unless the court finds compelling and extraordin­
ary reasons for not ordering restitution. The 
requirement is now contained in PC 1202.4. 
Prior Convictions 
The proposition provides that any prior felony 
conviction or any person in any criminal proceed­
ing may be used without limitation for purposes of 
impeachment or enhancement in any criminal 
proceedings. 
The Evidence Code, Section 788 provides that 
the judge in a criminal trial has discretion to 
exclude impeachment evidence of prior felony 
convictions of the accused, if the judge deter­
mined that the probative value and credibility of 
the prior convictions are outweighed by the risk of 
undue prejudice. In People v. Olmedo (167 CA 3d 
1085), a California Court of Appeals held that 
Proposition 8 did not change that section in that 
the judge still had the discretion to exclude the 
prior conviction, if the risk of undue prejudice 
outweighed the probative value of evidence. 
The California Supreme Court, in People v. 
Castro (38 C 3d 301), held that the drafters of the 
initiative did not intend to abolish a trial court's 
power to exclude certain evidence, but intended 
merely to<revert to the rule that, subject to the trial 
court's discretion, priors are admissable to 
impeach. 
Diminished Capacity 
The proposition abolished the defense of 
diminished capacity in all criminal proceedings. 
Accordingly, evidence of an accused's intoxica­
tion, trauma, mental illness, disease or defect is 
not admissable to negate the capacity to form a 
particular intent or motive (P C 25(a». Note: 

Modification of the Law 145 
evidence of diminished capacity may be consid­
ered by the court at the time of sentencing or other 
disposition. 
Insanity 
Proposition 8 restored the M' Naghten Rule as 
the test for legal insanity. This test is discussed in 
Chapter 4. 
Prior Conviction When an Element of the Offense 
The proposition provides that when a prior 
conviction is an element of the offense, it shall be 
proven to the jury (or judge in a court trial) in open 
court. This section was enacted to stop the prac­
tice of the defense in stipulating as to the prior 
conviction and thereby keeping from the jury the 
facts of the prior conviction. In People v. Callegri 
(154 CA 3d 856), a California Court of Appeals 
held that the trial court did not err in refusing to 
allow the defendant to stipulate to his prior convic­
tion where the prior conviction was element of the 
offense with which defendant was charged. 
Victim's Rights 
The right of the victim or the next of kin of the 
victim, if the victim is dead has a right to attend all 
sentencing proceedings and shall be given ade­
quate notice by the probation officer of all the 
proceedings. The victim or next of kin has the 
right to make a statement at the sentencing pro­
ceedings regarding the crime, the person respons­
ible, and the need for restitution. The trial court 
shall consider the statements of the victims or next 
of kin prior to imposing any sentence and shall 
make a statement on the record the court's conclu­
sion as to whether or not the defendant would pose 
a threat to public safety (p C 1191.1). The failure of 
the probation officer to comply with the notifica­
tion requirements set forth in Proposition 8, 
however, does not deprive a Superior Court of its 
jurisdiction to proceed (People v. Superior Court 
(Thompson) 154 CA 3d 319). 
Sentence Enhancement 
The proposition modified P C 667(a) to provide 
that any person convicted of a "serious felony" 
who has previously been convicted of a serious 
felony, shall receive, in addition to the sentence 
imposed by the court for the present offense, a five 
year enhancement for each such prior conviction. The terms for the present offense and each enhan­
cement shall run consecutively. In People v. Fritz 
(40 C 3d 227), the California Supreme Court held 
that a judge had discretionary power to strike a 
prior felony conviction and thereby forgo the 
additional five-year serious felony enhancement. 
Serious felonies for the purposes of this 
enhancement are those felonies listed in P C 
1192.7. Serious felonies include: 
1. murder or voluntary manslaughter 
2. rape 
3. mayhem 
4. sodomy by force, violence, duress, or 
fear of immediate and unlawful bodily 
injury on the victim, or another 
5. lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 
the age of 14 years 
6. any felony punishable by death or 
imprisonment for life 
7. oral copulation by force, threat, duress, 
etc. 
8. robbery 
9. kidnapping 
10. burglary of a residence 
11. selling, furnishing, etc. of heroin, 
cocaine, or PCP 
12. any felony where great bodily injury is 
inflicted on any person 
13. any felony in which the defendant uses a 
firearm 
14. arson 
15. assault by a life prisoner or with intent to 
commit rape or robbery 
16. assault with a deadly weapon or instru­
ment on a peace officer 
17. assault with a deadly weapon by an 
inmate
