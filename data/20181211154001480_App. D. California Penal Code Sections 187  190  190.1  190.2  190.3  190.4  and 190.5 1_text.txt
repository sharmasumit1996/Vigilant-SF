§ 190.3. Determination of death penalty or life imprisonment;
evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances; considerations
Currentness
If the defendant has been found guilty of murder in the first degree, and a special circumstance has been charged and
found to be true, or if the defendant may be subject to the death penalty after having been found guilty of violating
subdivision (a) of Section 1672 of the Military and Veterans Code or Sections 37, 128, 219, or 4500 of this code, the trier
of fact shall determine whether the penalty shall be death or confinement in state prison for a term of life without the
possibility of parole. In the proceedings on the question of penalty, evidence may be presented by both the people and
the defendant as to any matter relevant to aggravation, mitigation, and sentence including, but not limited to, the nature
and circumstances of the present offense, any prior felony conviction or convictions whether or not such conviction
or convictions involved a crime of violence, the presence or absence of other criminal activity by the defendant which
involved the use or attempted use of force or violence or which involved the express or implied threat to use force or
violence, and the defendant's character, background, history, mental condition and physical condition.
However, no evidence shall be admitted regarding other criminal activity by the defendant which did not involve the use
or attempted use of force or violence or which did not involve the express or implied threat to use force or violence. As
used in this section, criminal activity does not require a conviction.
However, in no event shall evidence of prior criminal activity be admitted for an offense for which the defendant was
prosecuted and acquitted. The restriction on the use of this evidence is intended to apply only to proceedings pursuant
to this section and is not intended to affect statutory or decisional law allowing such evidence to be used in any other
proceedings.
Except for evidence in proof of the offense or special circumstances which subject a defendant to the death penalty, no
evidence may be presented by the prosecution in aggravation unless notice of the evidence to be introduced has been
given to the defendant within a reasonable period of time as determined by the court, prior to trial. Evidence may be
introduced without such notice in rebuttal to evidence introduced by the defendant in mitigation.
The trier of fact shall be instructed that a sentence of confinement to state prison for a term of life without the possibility
of parole may in future after sentence is imposed, be commuted or modified to a sentence that includes the possibility
of parole by the Governor of the State of California.
In determining the penalty, the trier of fact shall take into account any of the following factors if relevant:
(a) The circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding and the existence of
any special circumstances found to be true pursuant to Section 190.1.
APPENDIX D

§ 190.3. Determination of death penalty or life imprisonment;..., CA PENAL § 190.3
 © 2018 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2(b) The presence or absence of criminal activity by the defendant which involved the use or attempted use of force or
violence or the express or implied threat to use force or violence.
(c) The presence or absence of any prior felony conviction.
(d) Whether or not the offense was committed while the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or
emotional disturbance.
(e) Whether or not the victim was a participant in the defendant's homicidal conduct or consented to the homicidal act.
(f) Whether or not the offense was committed under circumstances which the defendant reasonably believed to be a
moral justification or extenuation for his conduct.
(g) Whether or not defendant acted under extreme duress or under the substantial domination of another person.
(h) Whether or not at the time of the offense the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct
or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental disease or defect, or the affects
of intoxication.
(i) The age of the defendant at the time of the crime.
(j) Whether or not the defendant was an accomplice to the offense and his participation in the commission of the offense
was relatively minor.
(k) Any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.
After having heard and received all of the evidence, and after having heard and considered the arguments of counsel,
the trier of fact shall consider, take into account and be guided by the aggravating and mitigating circumstances referred
to in this section, and shall impose a sentence of death if the trier of fact concludes that the aggravating circumstances
outweigh the mitigating circumstances. If the trier of fact determines that the mitigating circumstances outweigh the
aggravating circumstances the trier of fact shall impose a sentence of confinement in state prison for a term of life without
the possibility of parole.

circumstance; penalty hearing; application for modification
Currentness
(a) Whenever special circumstances as enumerated in Section 190.2 are alleged and the trier of fact finds the defendant
guilty of first degree murder, the trier of fact shall also make a special finding on the truth of each alleged special
circumstance. The determination of the truth of any or all of the special circumstances shall be made by the trier of fact
on the evidence presented at the trial or at the hearing held pursuant to Subdivision (b) of Section 190.1.
In case of a reasonable doubt as to whether a special circumstance is true, the defendant is entitled to a finding that is
not true.1 The trier of fact shall make a special finding that each special circumstance charged is either true or not true.
Whenever a special circumstance requires proof of the commission or attempted commission of a crime, such crime shall
be charged and proved pursuant to the general law applying to the trial and conviction of the crime.
If the defendant was convicted by the court sitting without a jury, the trier of fact shall be a jury unless a jury is waived
by the defendant and by the people, in which case the trier of fact shall be the court. If the defendant was convicted by
a plea of guilty, the trier of fact shall be a jury unless a jury is waived by the defendant and by the people.
If the trier of fact finds that any one or more of the special circumstances enumerated in Section 190.2 as charged is true,
there shall be a separate penalty hearing, and neither the finding that any of the remaining special circumstances charged
is not true, nor if the trier of fact is a jury, the inability of the jury to agree on the issue of the truth or untruth of any of
the remaining special circumstances charged, shall prevent the holding of a separate penalty hearing.
In any case in which the defendant has been found guilty by a jury, and the jury has been unable to reach an unanimous
verdict that one or more of the special circumstances charged are true, and does not reach a unanimous verdict that all
the special circumstances charged are not true, the court shall dismiss the jury and shall order a new jury impaneled to
try the issues, but the issue of guilt shall not be tried by such jury, nor shall such jury retry the issue of the truth of any of
the special circumstances which were found by an unanimous verdict of the previous jury to be untrue. If such new jury
is unable to reach the unanimous verdict that one or more of the special circumstances it is trying are true, the court shall
dismiss the jury and in the court's discretion shall either order a new jury impaneled to try the issues the previous jury was
unable to reach the unanimous verdict on, or impose a punishment of confinement in state prison for a term of 25 years.
(b) If defendant was convicted by the court sitting without a jury the trier of fact at the penalty hearing shall be a jury
unless a jury is waived by the defendant and the people, in which case the trier of fact shall be the court. If the defendant
was convicted by a plea of guilty, the trier of fact shall be a jury unless a jury is waived by the defendant and the people.
If the trier of fact is a jury and has been unable to reach a unanimous verdict as to what the penalty shall be, the court
shall dismiss the jury and shall order a new jury impaneled to try the issue as to what the penalty shall be. If such new

new jury or impose a punishment of confinement in state prison for a term of life without the possibility of parole.
(c) If the trier of fact which convicted the defendant of a crime for which he may be subject to the death penalty was
a jury, the same jury shall consider any plea of not guilty by reason of insanity pursuant to Section 1026, the truth of
any special circumstances which may be alleged, and the penalty to be applied, unless for good cause shown the court
discharges that jury in which case a new jury shall be drawn. The court shall state facts in support of the finding of good
cause upon the record and cause them to be entered into the minutes.
(d) In any case in which the defendant may be subject to the death penalty, evidence presented at any prior phase of
the trial, including any proceeding under a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity pursuant to Section 1026 shall be
considered an any subsequent phase of the trial, if the trier of fact of the prior phase is the same trier of fact at the
subsequent phase.
(e) In every case in which the trier of fact has returned a verdict or finding imposing the death penalty, the defendant shall
be deemed to have made an application for modification of such verdict or finding pursuant to Subdivision 7 of Section
11.2 In ruling on the application, the judge shall review the evidence, consider, take into account, and be guided by the
aggravating and mitigating circumstances referred to in Section 190.3, and shall make a determination as to whether the
jury's findings and verdicts that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances are contrary to
law or the evidence presented. The judge shall state on the record the reasons for his findings.
The judge shall set forth the reasons for his ruling on the application and direct that they be entered on the Clerk's
minutes. The denial of the modification of the death penalty verdict pursuant to subdivision (7) of Section 1181 shall be
reviewed on the defendant's automatic appeal pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 1239. The granting of the application
shall be reviewed on the People's appeal pursuant to paragraph (6).
